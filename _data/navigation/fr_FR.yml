This was not a rash post of a sole developer, but rather had the support of the staff of various developer groups.<br><br>These moderators were entrusted to keep the community safe, but instead they attempted cover up the issue. <a href="https://0bin.net/paste/eBQtFS1iI-oUZ+Hi#LnzRA87qPu-r+3YfuVsSuBpQqtbgRznW3aWuls+XWJr">Some members of the staff did not want the community to be made aware at all</a>. Because of this censorship, I will no longer be associated with the /r/3dshacks subreddit or IRC until there is a change in leadership.<br><br>A post explaning the events (with additional information and evidence) can be found <a href="recent-community-events"><i>here</i></a>.
