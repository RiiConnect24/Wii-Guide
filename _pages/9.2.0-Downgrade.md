Some regions may downgrade to another version such as 9.1.0 or 9.0.0. This is fine as those versions function nearly the same for our purposes.

If you encounter this error and cannot use recovery mode, you can edit the connection settings as long as the 3DS completely fails to connect to any access point (such as if the point is out of range).
{: .notice--info}

This version of sysDowngrader (which is compatible with >9.2.0 systems) uses an unstable exploit, and because of this it may take many tries to work.
{: .notice--info}

{% capture notice-3 %}
If sysDowngrader crashes at any point during the downgrade (which can happen occasionally), you can power off the system by holding the power button. You will be left with what's called a "partial downgrade" or "partial", which is recoverable.

Although a partially downgraded system may show 9.2.0 as the system version, you are not done. You must restart from the beginning of Section II and downgrade a second time to install any files that were not installed. browserhax will work for partial downgrades as long as you are using the recommended version of sysDowngrader.

If you are are between versions 11.0.0 and 11.2.0, you MUST have [downgraded your NFIRM](nfirm-downgrade) to successfully complete this part.
{: .notice--warning}

{% capture notice-2 %}
**All** variations of sysUpdater, *not* just sysDowngrader, have a *very* small chance of causing a "soft brick" once the downgrade is complete and the device reboots. This will cause the system to boot directly to the Nintendo error screen instructing users to power off the device.

The reason for this is unknown, but can be prevented by performing a system format *before* downgrading. It seems to happen very often on systems with ambassador status or who have DSiWare installed.

Once this error happens, it can *only* be fixed by using recovery mode (boot holding A + R + L + Up on the D-Pad) to update to the latest system version.

As of the time this is written, the latest version (11.2.0) has completely blocked all software downgrading, and if someone encounters this error they will be locked out of any further downgrading unless they downgrade their NFIRM.

**You MUST downgrade with the correct pack for your console/region or you will BRICK.**
