The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provides brick protection.

#### 步骤

1. You will see a scam warning screen. Wait 30 seconds for the text "Press 1 to continue" to appear, then press 1. ![Scam Screen](/images/hackmii/scam.png)
1. You will be presented with a test results screen. Select `Continue`. ![Results](/images/hackmii/test_results.png)

If BootMii says that it `can only be installed as an IOS`, that's normal.

1. Select `Install the Homebrew Channel`. ![Homebrew Channel installation](/images/hackmii/hbc_install.png) ![Homebrew Channel installation OK](/images/hackmii/hbc_install_ok.png)
1. Select `Continue` when finished.
1. Once installed, select `Back`, then select `BootMii`. ![BootMii](/images/hackmii/bootmii_install.png)
1. Select `Install BootMii as IOS`.

If you do not have an SD card, you cannot install nor use BootMii, and therefore will not be able to utilize any of the mentioned benefits. <br> You can always [install it at a later date](hackmii).

1. Once done, select `Continue`.
1. If you have the option to `Install BootMii as boot2`, please do so as well. This offers the best possible brick protection you can have. <br> Otherwise, skip this step.
1. Select `Exit` to finally open the Homebrew Channel.


#### Required Reading

You can now use the Homebrew Channel to launch homebrew apps. Open Shop Channel is a one-stop shop for downloading homebrew, which you will learn how to install further in this guide.

Here's a tip - when installing homebrew applications on your SD Card or USB drive, your folder structure should look like this:

![Proper SD Card Folder Structure](images/Wii/FolderStructure.png)

`AppName1` and `AppName2` are placeholder names. Do not nest multiple `apps` folders inside the `apps` folder itself.

[Continue to making a NAND Backup using BootMii](bootmii)<br> Making a NAND backup with BootMii at this point is highly recommended.

If you couldn't install BootMii, continue to [installing Priiloader](priiloader).

Tip: You can tell if a Wii has BootMii installed as boot2 if your disc drive flashes very briefly, only after the immediate flash that happens when you press the POWER Button.
