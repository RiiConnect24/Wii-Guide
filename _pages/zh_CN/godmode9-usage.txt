title: "GodMode9 Usage"
---

GodMode9是一款适用于任天堂3DS的全权限文件管理器。它能够让你访问SD卡、真实系统或者虚拟系统中FAT文件分区以及其他任何地方的文件。 其更多的功能还包括复制、删除、重命名文件或者是创建文件夹。

Note that if you have any payload files other than `GodMode9.firm` in the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a "chainloader menu" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select "GodMode9" for these instructions. 

{% capture notice %}
This is powerful stuff, it provides you with the means to do basically any thinkable modification to any system data available on the 3DS console. However, precautions are taken so you don't accidentally damage the data of your console.

The write permissions system protects you by providing warnings and forces you to enter an unlock sequence for enabling write permissions. It is not possible to overwrite or modify any important stuff without such unlock sequences and it is not possible to accidentally unlock something. As always, be smart, keep backups, just to be safe.
