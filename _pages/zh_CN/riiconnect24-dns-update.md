Starting June 16th, 2022, our official DNS Address changes!

About a year ago we bought a new VPS that allowed us to serve our service better to the ever so growing community. Our DNS was the last thing to update.

The old address will be supported until it's `DEPRECATION` date. We will remind you using Wii Mail or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rc24) about the need to change the DNS Address in the next few months.

Here are the new DNS settings that you should enter in your Wii and your DS:

`167.86.108.126 should be your primary DNS.
1.1.1.1 should be your secondary DNS.`

Avoid using the old DNS, it will become `DEPRECATED` on June 1st, 2023.

Thank you for your support, RiiConnect24 Team.
