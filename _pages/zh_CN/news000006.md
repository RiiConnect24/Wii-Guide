If you're getting error NEWS000006 consistently, deleting the SYSCONF should fix it. Occasionally the error can be caused by a server problem, since the error technically means that it received invalid data, but that is very rare.

NOTE: Following this tutorial will erase all messages on your Wii Message Board (backup /title/00000001/00000002/data/cdb.vff if you want to keep it). It will also make you perform initial setup for your Wii again. You will not lose channels or save games.
