#### 步骤概览

{% capture notice-2 %}

The file `boot.firm` is what is launched by boot9strap itself after it finishes loading off of NAND, and can be any valid arm9 payload in the FIRM format. This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads in the FIRM format using the Luma3DS chainloader.
<br><br>
In this case, we use Luma3DS by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/) to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.
<br><br>
在这个过程当中，我们还会安装像下面所示的几个工具：    

+  **FBI** *(用来安装CIA格式的游戏和程序)*
+  **Themely** *(installs custom themes)*
+  **Luma3DS Updater** *(updates your CFW installation easily)*
+  **GodMode9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*
+  **Homebrew Launcher Loader** *(launches the Homebrew Launcher as a regular application thanks to Rosalina magic)*

    {: .notice--info}

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device

##### Section II - Updating the System

If, while following a previous version of this guide, you CTRTransfered your *New 3DS* to 2.1.0, now is the time to [restore your NAND backup](godmode9-usage#nand_restore) before doing this section.
{: .notice--danger}

If, before following this guide, you already had an EmuNAND setup and would like to move the contents of your previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, now is the time to [follow Move EmuNAND](move-emunand) before doing this section.
{: .notice--info}

1. Update your device by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
  + Updates while using B9S + Luma (what you have) are safe
  + If this gives you an error, set your DNS settings to "auto"
  + If this still gives you an error and your NAND is below 9.2.0, [follow 9.2.0 CTRTransfer](9.2.0-ctrtransfer), then try updating again

##### Section III - Launching FBI

1. Launch the Download Play application
1. Press (L) + (Down) + (Select) at the same time to open the Rosalina menu

1. Navigate to `SD` -> `cias`
1. Select "\<current directory>"
1. Select the "Install and delete all CIAs" option, then press (A) to confirm
1. Press (Home), then close Download Play

##### Section V - DSP Dump

1. Launch the DSP1 application

##### Section VI - CTRNAND Luma3DS

1. Launch GodMode9 by holding (Start) during boot
1. If you are prompted to create an essential files backup, press (A) to do so, then press (A) to continue once it has completed
1. Press (Home) to bring up the action menu
1. Select "More..."
1. Select "Scripts..."
1. Select "setup_ctrnand_luma3ds"
1. When prompted, press (A) to proceed
1. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND (lvl1) writing, then input the key combo given
1. Press (A) to continue
1. Press (A) to relock write permissions

##### Section VII - Backup SysNAND

1. Press (Home) to bring up the action menu
1. Select "More..."
1. Select "Scripts..."

你现在可以使用Luma3DS Updater来更新你的Luma3DS到最新版，只需运行该程序并按下(A)键。     
这和系统升级不是一回事；它只会下载并提取最新的Luma3DS文件。
This will only update the Luma3DS files on your SD card. If you boot your device without an SD card, it will use the version you placed in CTRNAND.

{% capture notice-6 %}   
You will now boot Luma3DS CFW SysNAND by default.    
你可以在启动时按下Select键，进入Luma3DS的设置菜单。    
You can now hold (Start) on boot to launch the Luma3DS chainloader menu (note that the Luma3DS chainloader menu is only displayed if there is more than one payload detected).    
You can now hold (Start) + (Select) + (X) on boot to dump the ARM11 bootrom (`boot11.bin`), the ARM9 bootrom (`boot9.bin`), and your console unique OTP (`OTP.bin`) to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card (note that this will not have any kind of prompt or message).    
You can now press (L) + (Down) + (Select) while the system is booted to open the Rosalina menu integrated into Luma3DS. For a full list of Rosalina features, please see the [Luma3DS v8.0 Release](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/releases/tag/v8.0)
