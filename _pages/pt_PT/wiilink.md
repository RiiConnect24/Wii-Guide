1. Visit the [WiiLink Patcher releases page](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher/releases) and download the correct patcher for your operating system.
1. On Windows, run `WiiLink_Patcher_Windows_v1.X.X.exe`. <br> On MacOS, right click the `WiiLink_Patcher_macOS_v1.X.X` file in Finder and click Open. <br> On Linux, open a Terminal, type `bash` (space included), then drag the file onto the Terminal window. It should look like this: `bash /path/to/WiiLink_Patcher_Linux-<arch>_v1.X.X`
1. Press `1` to choose "`Start Express Install Setup`".
1. Follow the on screen instructions to select which versions of the available channels you would like.
1. At step 6, press `1` to begin patching.
1. It may take a moment for the patcher to download the files to your SD Card or USB Drive.
1. Once it's done, you can safely close the patcher. All of the files are ready on your SD Card.
1. If it did not copy everything automatically to your SD Card or USB Device, copy the `WAD` and `apps` folder next to<br>`WiiLink_Patcher_<OS Platform>_v1.X.X` to the root of your SD Card or USB Device.
1. Put your SD card or USB drive in your Wii.
1. Launch the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.
1. Launch YAWM ModMii Edition.
1. Select your SD card or USB drive accordingly.
1. If your Wii is not a Japanese region, install `WiiLink_SPD (Wii).wad` or `WiiLink_SPD (vWii).wad` (Depending on console platform) before anything else. This is required so that we know your email address to send files.
1. Highlight all other WADs with `WiiLink` in the name and press + to select them. When all of them are selected, press A twice to install the WADs.
    - If you have previously installed the RiiConnect24 versions of the Forecast Channel and the Nintendo Channel, installing WiiLink's will overwrite them.

1. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.
