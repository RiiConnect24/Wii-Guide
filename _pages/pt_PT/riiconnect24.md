{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--warning">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

9. Type in `1.1.1.1` as the secondary DNS.
10. Seleciona `Confirm`, depois seleciona `Save`.
11. Seleciona `OK` para efetuar um teste de conexão.
12. Se o teste de conexão foi bem sucedido, seleciona `No` para saltar o Wii System Update.
13. Go to `WiiConnect24`, then `WiiConnect24` again, and make sure it is enabled.
14. Back on the WiiConnect24 menu, go to `Standby Connection` and make sure it is enabled.

If you get error 107245, then you have not installed the patched IOS.
{: .notice--warning}

If you get error 107304 or you see Nintendo's User Agreement without RiiConnect24's logo, that means your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or network is blocking the use of a DNS. You can set `Auto-Obtain DNS` to `On` to solve this. RiiConnect24 will still work without it. Or, you can use our [DNS-Server](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/releases/latest) program.
{: .notice--warning}

Se tiveres o erro FORE000006, o relógio da tua Wii provavelmente está mal definido. Set it to the correct date and time, then wait no more than an hour and the Forecast Channel may start working.
{: .notice--warning}

[If you still get FORE000006 or if you get NEWS000006, you will need to delete your SYSCONF with rc24-clear-tool](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/rc24-clear-tool/releases/latest).
{: .notice--warning}

[If you're getting any other errors with the Forecast Channel or the News Channel, such as an error code starting with FORE or NEWS or a discontinued message, you can try to delete your VFFs with rc24-clear-tool.](deleting-vffs)
{: .notice--warning}

If you're getting errors such as `WiiConnect24 and Wii Shop Channel currently not being offered in your country`, go to Wii Settings -> Last Page -> Country and change it to United Kingdom.
