The final Step of this guide is to install arm9loaderhax and setup Luma3DS to run just milliseconds into the boot. This is accomplished by using SafeA9LHInstaller by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/).

This will install [AuroraWright's Fork](https://github.com/AuroraWright/arm9loaderhax) of arm9loaderhax.
{: .notice--info}

We will also setup the ability to launch payloads from arm9loaderhax, giving us the ability to unbrick our SysNAND from situations that would normally brick us by restoring from backup.

To use the [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)

#### Overview of steps

In this section, we will go through the process that all the other steps have led up to: actually installing arm9loaderhax.

This is nearly the best possible kind of device exploit because it is permanently installable into the NAND firm partitions, and runs before most of the OS loads, allowing it to not only work on *all* versions once installed, but also protect itself and recover from most situations that would brick a non-A9LH 3DS such as a nonfunctional home menu or bad title install.

The file `arm9loaderhax.bin` is what is launched by arm9loaderhax itself after it finishes loading off of NAND, and can be any valid arm9 payload. This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads using the Luma3DS chainloader.

In this case, we use Luma3DS by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/) to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.

Once arm9loaderhax is installed and Luma3DS is setup with the correct options, we then restore our previous backup.

During this process, we also setup programs such as the following:    

+  **FBI** *(installs CIA formatted games and applications)*
+  **Luma3DS Updater** *(updates your CFW installation easily)*
+  **GodMode9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Prep Work

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. **If it exists, copy `<serialnumber>_nand.bin` from the `/ctrtransfer/` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your computer**
  + Make backups in multiple locations (such as online file storage)
  + This backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong in the future
1. Create a folder named `cias` on the root of your SD card if it does not already exist
1. Create a folder named `files9` on the root of your SD card if it does not already exist
1. Delete the `3ds` folder from the root of your SD card if it exists
1. Copy _the contents of_ the `starter` folder in `starter.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + This will include a brand new `3ds` folder to replace the one you just deleted
1. Copy _the contents of_ the SafeA9LHInstaller `.7z` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy the `a9lh` folder from the data_input `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy _the contents of_ the arm9loaderhax release `.7z` to `a9lh` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `hblauncher_loader.cia` from the hblauncher_loader `.zip` to the `/cias/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `lumaupdater.cia` from the Luma3DS Updater `.zip` to the `/cias/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `FBI.cia` from the FBI `.zip` to the `/cias/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `arm9loaderhax.bin` from the Luma3DS `.7z` to the root of your SD card, overwrite existing files
1. Create a folder named `luma` on the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder named `payloads` in the `luma` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `GodMode9.bin` from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card and rename `GodMode9.bin` in `/luma/payloads/` to `start_GodMode9.bin`
1. Copy `aeskeydb.bin` to the `/files9/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `DspDump.3dsx` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card

##### Section II - Installing arm9loaderhax

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. You should be already on 2.1.0 and powered on
1. Go to URL `http://2xrsa.3ds.guide` in the browser of your device
  + If you get the error "This service is not available in your region", use the System Settings to set your device's country to match the NAND region you installed with 2.1.0 CTRTransfer
  + If you get another error, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_browser)
  + If you get a glitched screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_safe_a9lh_screen)
  + If you are on a 2DS or New 3DS and Wireless Communication is off, you can re-enable the wireless by removing the battery and unplugging the charger for several seconds then booting back up
1. Press (Select) to Full Install
1. The installer will now install arm9loaderhax on your device (this is very fast)
1. Power off your device by pressing any button
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy your device specific `otp.bin` from the `/a9lh/` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your computer and back it up to multiple locations (such as online file storage), then reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device

##### Section III - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Boot your device while holding (Select) to enter the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + Make sure to start holding the button before pressing power
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_sys_a9lh)   
  + If you boot to SafeA9LHInstaller, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_safe_a9lh)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:    
  + **"Autoboot SysNAND"**
  + **"Use SysNAND FIRM if booting with R"**
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
1. If you are using a **New 3DS**, you can *also* enable the following:
  + **"New 3DS CPU" to "Clock+L2(x)"**
    + This will increase the framerate of many games, but may cause instability in others
    + If some games do not work properly, disable this option and try again
    + **This breaks the Homebrew Launcher on 11.3!**
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot
  + If you get a black screen, just continue to the next section   
  + If you get a "Failed to mount CTRNAND" error, just continue to the next section     

##### Section IV - Restoring the System

If, before following this guide, you already had an EmuNAND setup and would like to move the contents of your previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, now is the time to [follow Move EmuNAND](move-emunand) instead of doing the first four steps in this section.

1. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND overwriting, then input the key combo given
  + This will not overwrite your arm9loaderhax installation
1. Input the key combo given to unlock SysNAND (lvl1) writing
  + This process will take some time
1. Press (A) to continue once it has completed
1. Press (Start) to reboot your device
  + If you get a black screen, [follow 9.2.0 CTRTransfer](9.2.0-ctrtransfer)
  + It is now safe to put New 3DSs in sleep mode again
1. If your backup was of a version between 3.0.0 and 4.5.0, your device will not boot until you manually download the required firmware:
  + Download [this file](http://nus.cdn.c.shop.nintendowifi.net/ccs/download/0004013800000002/00000056) and rename it to `firmware.bin`
  + Download [this file](http://nus.cdn.c.shop.nintendowifi.net/ccs/download/0004013800000002/cetk)
  + Copy `firmware.bin` and `cetk` to the `/luma/` folder on your SD card
  + Delete both of these files after updating your device
1. Update your device by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
  + Updates while using A9LH + Luma (what you have) are safe, stop asking about it
  + The warning about never updating a New 3DS from 2.1.0 does not apply after restoring your NAND backup.
  + If this gives you an error, set your DNS settings to "auto"
  + If this still gives you an error and your NAND is below 9.2.0, [follow 9.2.0 CTRTransfer](9.2.0-ctrtransfer)
