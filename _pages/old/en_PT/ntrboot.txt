If ye already flashed ntrboot to ye flashcart, ye can be followin' [Installin' boot9strap (ntrboot)](installing-boot9strap-(ntrboot)) fer instructions on how to use it.
{: .notice--success}

Installin' boot9strap wit' ntrboot needs a compatible DS / DSi flashcart to flash ntrboot to.

The ntrboot exploit itself is compatible with the following flashcarts:

  + [R4i Gold 3DS (RTS)](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149)
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160)
  + R4i Gold 3DS "Starter"
  + R4i Ultra
  + R4 3D Revolution
  + Infinity 3 R4i

  {: .notice--info}

Note that specific methods may have additional compatibility information.

The usage of this exploit, regardless of flashing method, requires access to a small magnet if the target device is of a folding style (any 3DS family system that is not the old 2DS with a sleep switch). 'Tis be because th' exploit requires ye device to be enterin' sleep mode while still havin' access to th' buttons.

To test if a magnet gunna work, hold it on or around th' (A)(B)(X)(Y) buttons while th' device be powered on to see if it be triggerin' sleep mode. If it does, both displays gunna be goin' black as long as th' magnet be held in that spot.
{: .notice--info}

Note that th' flashcart not gunna be usable fer its standard functions while th' ntrboot exploit be installed on it (except in th' case 'o th' Acekard 2i, which be remainin' functional *on 3DS systems wit' custom firmware installed only*). There be optional steps at th' end 'o th' ntrboot flashin' instructions to remove it from ye flashcart when ye be done.

Note that in some rare cases, it may be possible fer th' flashin' process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart n' render it permanently unusable. 'Tis be unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts be supported. To reduce th' chance 'o recievin' a counterfeit card, it be recommended that ye use a reputable site to be buyin' ye flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))

[Flashing ntrboot (3DS Single System)](flashing-ntrboot-(3ds-single-system))

This method requires nothing more than your stock unhacked 3DS and a compatible flashcart.

Note that more recent 3DS versions have blocked access to some flashcarts, and some flashcarts have always been blocked on the 3DS. This leaves them unable to launch the flasher `.nds` file on some (or all) versions. The ntrboot compatible flashcarts are able to launch `.nds` files on the 3DS (under the listed versions):

  + [R4i Gold 3DS (RTS)](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149) : <= 11.5.0
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160) : <= 4.3.0
  + R4i Gold 3DS "Starter" : 4.1.0 - 4.5.0
