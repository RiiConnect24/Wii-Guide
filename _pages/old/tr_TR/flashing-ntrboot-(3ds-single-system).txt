title: "Flashing ntrboot (3DS Single System)"
---

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

This method requires nothing more than your stock unhacked 3DS and a compatible flashcart.

Note that more recent 3DS versions have blocked access to some flashcarts, and some flashcarts have always been blocked on the 3DS. This leaves them unable to launch the flasher `.nds` file on some (or all) versions. The ntrboot compatible flashcarts are able to launch `.nds` files on the 3DS (under the listed versions):

  + [R4i Gold 3DS (RTS)](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149) : <= 11.5.0
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160) : <= 4.3.0
  + R4i Gold 3DS "Starter" : 4.1.0 - 4.5.0
  + R4i Ultra : <= 4.3.0
  + Infinity 3 R4i : <= 11.5.0

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
