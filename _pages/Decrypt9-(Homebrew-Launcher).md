Due to a bug, safehax currently requires a functioning cartridge of some kind (3ds, nds, flashcart, etc) to be inserted in order to complete successfully. As a temporary workaround, users less than or equal to 9.2.0 who do not own any cartridges can copy `Decrypt9WIP.3dsx` to `/3ds/` and run it directly without any hax.
