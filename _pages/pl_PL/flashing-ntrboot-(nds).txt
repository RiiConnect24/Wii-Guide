Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

Note that R4i Gold 3DS RTS flashcarts will not be able to be used for their standard functions (such as launching `.nds` files) while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it. This does not apply to the Acekard 2i.

There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot boot9strap installation instructions to remove the ntrboot exploit from your flashcart when you are done.

This method requires temporary access to a Nintendo DS or Nintendo DS Lite that is compatible with your flashcart. Note that this method is *not* compatible with the Nintendo DSi. It is compatible with the following flashcarts:

  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160)
  + [R4i Gold 3DS RTS](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149)

If you would like to remove the ntrboot exploit and restore your flashcart to its original state, note that you should *not* power off your NDS / NDSL until you have restored your flashcart. This is because the R4i Gold 3DS RTS flashcart cannot be used to launch `.nds` files while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it, so if you exit the flasher application you will not be able to re-enter it.

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
