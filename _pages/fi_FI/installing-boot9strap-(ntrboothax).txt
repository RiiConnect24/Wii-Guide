The ntrboothax exploit will require the following:

+ A DS / DSi flashcart
  + Exact flashcart compatibility will be added when this exploit is released
+ Pienen magneetin
  + Note that this is only required on folding style 3DSs/2DSs (everything except the Old 2DS with the sleep switch)
  + This is because the exploit requires your device to enter sleep mode while still having access to the buttons
  + The magnet should be able to trigger your device's sleep mode by holding it on or around the ABXY buttons
+ *One* of the following methods of installing ntrboothax to your flashcart:
  + A [Powersaves](https://amzn.to/2fb3VY7)
  + Another 3DS or 2DS already running some kind of custom firmware (such as boot9strap or arm9loaderhax)
