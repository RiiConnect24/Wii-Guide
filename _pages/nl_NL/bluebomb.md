BlueBomb is an exploit that takes advantage of a flaw in the Wii and Wii mini's Bluetooth libraries. Although it is the only exploit that works for the Wii mini, BlueBomb can run on the original Wii as well. This exploit also enables recovery from certain bricks, such as a banner brick.

For the original Wii, we do not recommend using BlueBomb if you intend to install the Homebrew Channel and BootMii, as there are more convenient exploits available.

This exploit will not work on a Wii U's vWii. Please follow [this guide](https://wiiuguide.xyz/#/vwii-modding) instead.

#### Section I - What you need
- A Linux machine
  - If you have a Raspberry Pi, you can use that instead as it most likely has Linux installed already.
  - Windows Subsystem for Linux will *not work* as it does not have direct access to the Bluetooth adapter or USB ports.
  - If you do not have Linux, [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) is the most user-friendly option and can be ran on computers running Windows or Mac.
    - 32-bit devices will require [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/).
    - For 64-bit devices it is recommended to use the LTS edition due to its stability, but the latest release works as well.
  - You can [flash a Linux install to a USB flash drive](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) instead of installing it to your computer.
- A Bluetooth adapter.
  - An internal Bluetooth adapter will work.
  - If you do not have one, make sure to get one compatible with Linux.
- A USB flash drive formatted as FAT32.
  - This cannot be the same flash drive used for your Linux Machine.

#### Section II - Performing the exploit
1. Download the HackMii installer from [the BootMii website](https://bootmii.org/download/).
- (If attempting to fix a brick, you should also copy the homebrew app you wish to use to /apps/)
1. Unpack it and place the `boot.elf` file in your flash drive.
1. Connect the flash drive to the console. For a Wii mini, the USB port is on the back. For a normal Wii, use the bottom port. (or the right port if it's upright).
1. Turn on your console and navigate to the settings menu. On the top right corner you should see a 4-character code like the one in the picture below. This code is your Wii Menu version, take a note of this as you will need it later. Afterwards, turn your console off. (If you're trying to use BlueBomb to recover from a brick, you can assume your Wii Menu version is 4.3.) ![SystemMenuVersion](/images/Wii/SystemMenuVersion.png)
1. Start your Linux distro, and ensure you are connected to the internet.
1. Open the Terminal
1. Run the following commands:
```bash
wget https://wii.guide/assets/files/bluebomb-helper.sh
chmod +x bluebomb-helper.sh
./bluebomb-helper.sh
```
1. The helper will then download the required files, and ask for information about your console.
  - If you have selected a Wii mini you will be asked to provide your region. This can be determined by the last letter of the Wii Menu version (`U` for **USA** and `E` for **PAL** models).
  - If you have selected a Wii you will be asked to provide your Wii Menu Version (What you determined in step 4)
1. Turn on your console and **do not** connect any Wiimotes.
1. Press the Sync button repeatedly until the terminal shows `got connection handle`. This could take numerous attempts, so don't give up.

Make sure that the console is close to the computer running the exploit, ideally it should be less than 3 feet.

The console should now boot to the HackMii installer. You can now shutdown your Linux computer if you are not planning to use it later.
