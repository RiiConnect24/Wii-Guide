#### What ye need

Note that the following required file named `secret_sector.bin` is the same one that was found in the various `data_input.zip` file versions. If you already have that file on your disk somewhere, you can use that one instead of downloading the one below.
{: .notice--info}

Note that, on New 3DS, `secret_sector.bin` is needed to revert the arm9loaderhax exploit, which is why it is not needed for the installation of boot9strap on a stock console. If you do not have a New 3DS, you do not need `secret_sector.bin`.
