This project is the culmination of hundreds upon hundreds of hours of constant work.

I maintain 'tis guide, fer free, 'n ensure it be always up to date. Because of this effort, I feel that it is fair for me to attempt to gain a meager income from my work (I receive next to no donations anymore).

'Tis site be costin' ye nothin' to use, 'n all that I display be non-intrusive ads. If ye still have a problem wit' 'tis, feel free to be blockin' these ads.

If you do block ads, I would like to also remind you of the [Donations](donations) page, but once again that is optional too.

Thanks,<br>
