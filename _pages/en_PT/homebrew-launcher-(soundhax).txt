1. If you've never opened Nintendo 3DS Sound before and get tips on how to use it from a bird icon, go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and relaunch it
  + In this situation, launching Soundhax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
1. Go to `/SDCARD`, then play "<3 nedwill 2016"
  + This may take many tries
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
  + If you get a red screen, ensure you copied _the contents of_ the `starter` folder to the root of your SD card
