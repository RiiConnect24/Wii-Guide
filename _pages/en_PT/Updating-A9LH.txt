### Last Update: 3 Nov 2016

The actual installation of arm9loaderhax itself consists of payload files installed into the NFIRM partitions on your device's NAND chip, which is soldered to the motherboard itself. These payloads are updated rarely and only really serve the purpose of launching `arm9loaderhax.bin` from your SD card, which is, in our case, Luma3DS.
{: .notice}

If you do not know what version of arm9loaderhax you are running, just install the latest version with these steps. Installing the latest version while already on the latest version will have no effect.
{: .notice--info}

If you have a PIN set on Luma, you must temporarily turn it off to do these steps. You can re-enable the PIN after the update.
{: .notice--info}

If you are using a payload that does not init the screen on its own (such as Bootanim9), you will need to rename it to `arm9loaderhax_si.bin` instead of `arm9loaderhax.bin`
{: .notice--info}

The versions of data_input only refer to revisions of the `.zip` to be compatible with different installer versions, and are *not* the same thing as updating a9lh itself (the payload files). They make no practical difference beyond the installation process.

To use the [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)
{: .notice--info}

These steps will also update your various payloads and the AES key database.
