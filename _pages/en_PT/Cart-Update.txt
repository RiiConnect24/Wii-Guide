All game carts contain a copy of the required system version to play it, allowing anyone on a lower version to use the cartridge to update to that version (even without an internet connection).
{: .notice--info}

Cart Updates will only deliver updates to core features, such as the System Settings, Home Menu, Nintendo 3DS Sound, etc. Cart Updates will not deliver updates to Network features, such as System Transfer, Internet Browser, StreetPass Mii Plaza or eShop.
{: .notice--info}

This means that a cart update will NOT install a browser if you do not already have one. This will **only** update the actual system version *(for example, 2.1.0-0 -> 6.0.0-0)*. The last number *(the -0)* will **not** change.
{: .notice--warning}

**Updating with a game cart containing the version 9.9.0 or above will remove your browser!**
