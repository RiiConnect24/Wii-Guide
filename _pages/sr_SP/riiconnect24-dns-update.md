Our official DNS Address has been updated. We require all users to change it. Failure in doing so will result in losing access to most or every RiiConnect24 service.

The old address will be supported until its `DEPRECATION` date. We will remind you using Wii Mail or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rc24) about the need to change the DNS Address in the next few months.

The old DNS Server will stop working on `June 1st, 2023`.
{: .notice--warning}

We've restricted access to Forecast Channel and News Channel for users still using the old DNS Address. Users will also see a new EULA when trying to enable WiiConnect24 reminding them about the change. ![The notification on the EULA confirmation screen.](/images/eula_change_dns_notification.png) ![The notification on the Forecast Channel](/images/forecast_change_dns_notification.png) ![The notification on the News Channel](/images/news_channel_change_dns_notification.png)
