DO NOT INSTALL RIICONNECT24 ON A WII MINI! It will not work and it will brick the system.

### What you need

* A computer with either Windows 7 or newer or any Unix-based system
* [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/)
* [RiiConnect24 Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-Patcher/releases)

#### 手順

##### Section I - Installing Dolphin

If you have Dolphin already installed, skip to Section II
{: .notice--info}

1. Download the latest Dolphin beta version, but **not a stable version as these are very outdated!**
2. Extract the .7z file using a program like 7-Zip or WinRAR.
3. Start Dolphin.
4. In Dolphin, go to `Tools` -> `Perform Online System Update` -> Choose your region. ![Perform Online System Update](/images/Dolphin_RC24/1.jpg)

If you have a homebrewed Wii console, you can use a [BootMii NAND dump](bootmii) instead of installing the system files with the System Update option. See [this page](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=NAND_Usage_Guide) for more information.

##### Section II - Installing RiiConnect24

1. Click the link above to go to the GitHub page where the patcher is.
2. Download `RiiConnect24Patcher.bat` if you are on Windows, and `RiiConnect24Patcher.sh` if you are on a Unix system
3. On Windows run `RiiConnect24Patcher.bat`. On Unix systems, open Terminal and type `bash`, then drag `RiiConnect24Patcher.sh` into the terminal then press enter. It should look like this: `bash RiiConnect24Patcher.sh`.
4. 「`Start`」を選ぶために`1`を押してから、`ENTER`を押して。 (NOTE: These screenshots are from the Windows version of the patcher.)
5. For this guide, choose "`Install RiiConnect24 on your Dolphin Emulator`" ![Install RiiConnect24](/images/RC24_Patcher/3.JPG)
6. Choose "`Express (Recommended)`". It will give you everything you need. ![Express Settings](/images/RC24_Patcher/4.JPG)
7. Select your region. ![Select your region](/images/RC24_Patcher/5.JPG)
8. While you're at it, RiiConnect24 Patcher can additionally download some other optional channels that do not use RiiConnect24. `[X]` represents the options that selected. Just press 5 and `ENTER` if you're not interested. !\[Additional optional channels\](/images/RC24_Patcher/6.JPG
9. Press `1` then `ENTER` to start patching.
10. Be patient... ![It's patching!](/images/RC24_Patcher/9.JPG)
11. After it's done, we would appreciate if you take a minute to send anonymous feedback to us.  If you don't want to, close the patcher. All the files should already be on your SD Card. ![It's done!](/images/RC24_Patcher/10.JPG) ![Files copied](/images/RC24_Patcher/11.PNG)
12. In Dolphin, go to `Tools` and then `Install WAD`. Install all the WAD files one by one.

You're all done! Unfortunately, Wii Mail doesn't work in Dolphin yet.
{: .notice--info}

Dolphin now supports WiiConnect24 natively. It's not perfect, but it works enough. Issues include having error code 109144 on the region selector, or having to open the Everybody Votes Channel multiple times during initial setup in order to see the poll questions.
