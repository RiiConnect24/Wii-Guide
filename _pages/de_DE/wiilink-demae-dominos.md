{: .notice--info}

You no longer need to pay $1 to get and use Food Delivery Channel (Domino's). It's now completely _free_!
{: .notice--info}

As this service places an order to Domino's Pizza, payment is required at the door. This is usually in the form of cash, although credit/debit card machines are possible if the delivery person has one.
{: .notice--info}

Currently, only the USA and Canada are supported.
{: .notice--warning}

You cannot use the default Dolphin NAND with this service. You must use your own NAND dump. This can be done in Dolphin by going to the toolbar and clicking `Tools -> Manage NAND -> Import BootMii NAND Backup`.

#### Anleitung

##### Section I - Getting Started

1. Download the latest version of the WiiLink Patcher, available [here](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher/tree/csharp-ver).
2. Make sure to download the version in the README that corresponds to your operating system.
3. Launch the patcher and begin the setup process.
4. When you see the setup screen, select `1. English Translation` in order to gain access to the Food Delivery Channel (Domino's) channel.<br><br> ![Express Install](/images/Demae-Dominos/choose-core-channel.png)
5. Next, you’ll see this screen, asking which version of Food Delivery Channel you want, so you’ll want to pick `2. Domino's (US and Canada only)`<br><br> ![Food Delivery Channel Setup](/images/Demae-Dominos/choose-food-channel-ver.png)
6. After that, you can go through the rest of the process, but once you reach this step, be sure to pick the correct console platform you’re installing this on, as it will matter when using the app.<br><br> ![Console Platform](/images/Demae-Dominos/choose-console-platform.png)

##### Section II - Registering your Console ID

1. After completing the setup process, go to the [**WiiLink Discord server**](https://discord.gg/wiilink-750581992223146074) to register your Wii's console ID.
2. Use the `Get Console ID` Homebrew app, that was given by the patcher, to retrieve your system's console ID.
3. Visit the `#dominos-chat` channel on the Discord server.
4. Type the command `/dominos <your console ID>` in the chat, replacing `<your console ID>` with your actual console ID. Make sure the ID is in the parameter box, otherwise the command will not work and will be posted publicly on the channel.
5. Double-check that you've typed the correct console ID, as it can't be re-registered. If you need to re-register, ask a staff member in the server for assistance.

##### Section III - Installing WADs

You will now install the Food Delivery Channel and Set Personal Data channels.

1. Put your SD card or USB drive in your Wii.
2. After registering your console ID, go to the Homebrew Channel and launch YAWM ModMii Edition.
3. In the WAD Manager menu, locate `Food Channel (Domino's) (English).wad`.
4. Also locate `WiiLink_SPD (Wii).wad` or `WiiLink_SPD (vWii).wad`, depending on your console platform.
5. Select both WADs by pressing `+` on each one.
6. Press `A` to install the selected WADs.

If you happen to get `Error -1022` when installing `Food Channel (Domino's) (English).wad`, uninstall the channel by selecting the WAD with `-` and pressing `A`. Then, re-install the WAD.
