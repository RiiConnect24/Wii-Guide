Modmii is a PC program for windows created by XFlak that has various helpful tools for modding, including some tutorials that may not be currently available here on the [wii.guide](site-navigation) website. <br> You can choose to launch in Modmii skin, which has a more user friendly approach, or launch in Modmii Classic, which interacts like a PC terminal or command prompt.

Some advanced options may not be accessible in Modmii Skin. A list of the various activities for Modmii Classic can be found at the bottom of the page.

#### What you need

* Eine Wii
* A USB drive or SD Card
* A Windows PC (a Virtual Machine will work)
* [Modmii](https://modmii.github.io/)

This is a quick start guide on how to use Modmii on your Windows PC.

## ModMii Wizard

You can use the ModMii wizard to softmod any Wii. <br> Even if the Wii has been softmodded in the past, you can have ModMii overwrite existing softmods by telling ModMii that this is the first time you're modding your Wii (even though it's not).

You can also use this wizard to set up a USB loader at the same time, instead of having to use the USB Loader setup wizard later on.

## SysCheck Updater Wizard

[SysCheck](syscheck) is a homebrew application that analyzes the modifications on a Wii. <br> You can give a SysCheck report to ModMii to help identify & update outdated mods.

You can have ModMii analyze a SysCheck by dragging the `syscheck.csv` file onto ModMii.exe. Or, you can launch the SysCheck Updater Wizard (`SU`) from ModMii's main menu and manually browse for the file.

## HackMii Solutions Wizard

The HackMii Solutions wizard can help fix symptoms like these:
  - HackMii Installer not prompting "Press (1) to continue"
  - HackMii Installer says "no vulnerable IOS found!"
  - Homebrew Channel is displaying upside-down

It will install clean IOSs to allow for the HackMii Installer to operate properly.

## Abstinence Wizard

This wizard requires an SD card.
{: .notice--warning}

This wizard allows you to enjoy many of the benefits of a softmodded Wii without installing any permanent modifications to your Wii. It will allow you to launch an exploit to boot an from emulated NAND from external storage, instead of your Wii's internal NAND.

On a related note, you can also make a NAND backup without modifying your Wii at all. Find ModMii's "Support" folder and launch `Casper2BootMii.bat`. <br> It will save some files to a folder named `COPY_TO_SD`, copy the files inside it to your SD card and [launch an exploit](get-started).

When following one of the exploit guides above, please avoid replacing the `boot.elf` file.
