#### Anleitung

##### Section I - Patching WADs

[If you want to see detailed instructions on how to install the WADs, click here!](wiimodlite)
{: .notice--info}

1. Download `WiiLink_Patcher_<OS Platform>_v1.X.X`, where `<OS Platform>` is either `Windows`, `macOS`, or `Linux`, depending on your operating system.
2. Connect your SD Card or USB Drive to your computer. Make sure there is an `apps` folder on the root of the SD Card or USB Device in order for the patcher to automatically detect your SD Card or USB Device.
3. To open the patcher on Windows, simply double-click on `WiiLink_Patcher_Windows_v1.X.X.exe`.

   On macOS and Linux, you'll need to follow these steps:
   - First, give the file executable permissions by typing<br>`chmod +x WiiLink_Patcher_<OS Platform>_v1.X.X` in your terminal. Replacing<br>`<OS Platform>` with either `macOS` or `Linux`, depending on your operating system.
   - Then, run the patcher by typing `./WiiLink_Patcher_<OS Platform>_v1.X.X` in the same terminal window.
4. If your portable storage device was detected successfully, you should see a message saying `SD Card detected`. If not, you'll need to manually select the location of your SD Card or USB Device.
5. Press 1 to choose `Start` on the main menu, to start the Express Install Setup of WiiLink.
6. Follow the on screen instructions to select which versions of the available channels you would like.
7. It may take a moment for the patcher to download the files to your SD Card or USB Drive.
8. Once it's done, you can safely close the patcher. All of the files are ready on your SD Card.
9. If it did not copy everything automatically to your SD Card or USB Device, copy the `WAD` and `apps` folder next to<br>`WiiLink_Patcher_<OS Platform>_v1.X.X` to the root of your SD Card or USB Device.
10. Put your SD card or USB drive in your Wii.
11. Starte den Homebrew-Kanal auf deiner Wii.
12. Launch Wii Mod Lite.
13. Using the +Control Pad on your Wii Remote, navigate to `WAD Manager`, and then navigate to the `wad` folder.
14. If your Wii is not a Japanese region, install `WiiLink_SPD (Wii).wad` or `WiiLink_SPD (vWii).wad` (Depending on console platform) before anything else. This is required so that we know your email address to send files.
15. Highlight all other WADs with `WiiLink` in the name and press + to select them. When all of them are selected, press A twice to install the WADs.
    - If you have previously installed the RiiConnect24 versions of the Forecast Channel and the Nintendo Channel, installing WiiLink's will overwrite them.

16. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.
