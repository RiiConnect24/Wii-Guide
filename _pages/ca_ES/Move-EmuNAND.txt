This is an add-on section for moving the contents of a previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, then removing the old EmuNAND partition. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).
{: .notice--info}

Note that, on some versions of Luma3DS, the Luma3DS chainloader menu is only displayed if there is more than one payload detected. If there is only one payload detected, holding (Start) on boot will directly launch GodMode9.
{: .notice--info}

**You MUST have already installed Luma3DS and boot9strap or arm9loaderhax to use this.**
{: .notice--danger}

#### Què necessiteu

* An existing EmuNAND
* The latest release of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest)
