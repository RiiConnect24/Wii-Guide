This is an add-on section for moving the contents of a previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, then removing the old EmuNAND partition. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).
{: .notice--info}

**You MUST have already installed arm9loaderhax + Luma3DS to use this.**
