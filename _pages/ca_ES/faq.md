### How risky is hacking my console?
Bricks (a state where either some parts of your Wii software are not working, or your Wii is not working at all) are now *basically* impossible unless you ignore/circumvent all safety checks.

### Where should I go for support?
Either email us at support@riiconnect24.net or join the [RiiConnect24 Discord Server](https://discord.gg/b4Y7jfD).

### What are the SD card requirements and/or recommendations?
You will need an SD card with at least 128MB to run an exploit.

- If you are using the LetterBomb exploit, your SD card should be no larger than 32 GB.
- If you are using the BlueBomb exploit, you do not need an SD card

To store homebrew applications, we recommend an SD card with at least 2 GB.

### What are the limitations in vWii modding?
The following is a list of things that can potentially **BRICK** your vWii (don't do these things!):
* Installing IOS for a Wii console on vWii.
* Installing Wii menu themes not formatted correctly for vWii and/or your region.
* Installing BootMii and/or Priiloader/Preloader.
* Failure during the install of crucial system/IOS titles (e.g. power outage).
* Modifying the vWii NAND without knowing what you are doing.
