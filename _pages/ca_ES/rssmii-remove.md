#### What you need

* An SD card
* [RSSMii Remover](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/rssmii/releases)

#### Instructions

1. Extract RSSMii Remover and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD card.
2. Delete the `feeds.xml` file on the root of your SD card.

In case you would like to revert your decision, you can always [reinstall RSSMii](rssmii).
