---

The final Step of this guide is to install arm9loaderhax and setup Luma3DS to run just milliseconds into the boot. This is accomplished by using SafeA9LHInstaller by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/).
{: .notice}

This will install [AuroraWright's Fork](https://github.com/AuroraWright/arm9loaderhax) of arm9loaderhax.
{: .notice--info}

We will also setup the ability to launch payloads from arm9loaderhax, giving us the ability to unbrick our SysNAND from situations that would normally brick us by restoring from backup.

**You cannot use another console's OTP or you will brick GUARANTEED.**

#### Overview of steps

In this section, we will go through the process that all the other steps have led up to: actually installing arm9loaderhax.

This is nearly the best possible kind of device exploit because it is permanently installable into the NAND firm partitions, and runs before most of the OS loads, allowing it to not only work on *all* versions once installed, but also protect itself and recover from most situations that would brick a non-A9LH 3DS such as a nonfunctional home menu or bad title install.

The file `arm9loaderhax.bin` is what is launched by arm9loaderhax itself after it finishes loading off of NAND, and can be any valid arm9 payload. This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads by holding buttons on boot.

In this case, we use Luma3DS by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/) to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.

Once arm9loaderhax is installed and Luma3DS is setup with the correct options, we then restore our previous backup.

During this process, we also setup programs such as the following:
+  **FBI** *(installs CIA formatted games and applications)*
+  **Luma3DS Updater** *(updates our CFW installation easily)*
+  **Hourglass9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*

##### Section II - Installing arm9loaderhax

1. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS
2. Do the steps for installing arm9loaderhax on your device:

+ Old 3DS
  + You should be on 2.1.0
  + Go to `http://dukesrg.github.io/2xrsa.html?arm11.bin` on your 3DS
    + If you get an error, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_browser)
    + If you get a glitched screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_safe_a9lh_screen)
  + Press (Select) to Full Install
  + The installer will now install arm9loaderhax on your device (this is very fast)
  + Shut down your console, hold the power button until it turns off if necessary
  + Copy your console specific `OTP.bin` from the `/a9lh/` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your computer and back it up to multiple locations (such as online file storage), then reinsert your SD card into your 3DS
+ New 3DS
  + Get into the homebrew launcher through the entrypoint of your choice
  + Launch SafeA9LHInstaller
    + If you get a glitched screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_safe_a9lh_screen)
  + Press (Select) to Full Install
  + The installer will now install arm9loaderhax on your device (this is very fast)
  + Shut down your console, hold the power button until it turns off if necessary

##### Section III - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Hold select on boot to enter the Luma3DS menu
  + Make sure to start holding the button before pressing power
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_sys_a9lh)

    + If some games do not work properly, disable this option and try again
4. Press Start to save and reboot
  + If you get a black screen, just continue to the next section   

##### Section IV - Restoring the System

If, before following this guide, you already had an EmuNAND setup and would like to move the contents of your previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, now is the time to [follow Move EmuNAND](move-emunand) instead of doing the first step in this section.
{: .notice--info}
