If you no longer wish to use RSSMii (maybe because it gives you too much Wii Mail), here's how to remove it.

#### 必備項目

* An SD card
* [RSSMii Remover](https://oscwii.org/library/app/rssmii-remover)

#### 操作說明

1. Extract RSSMii Remover and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD card.
2. Delete the `feeds.xml` file on the root of your SD card.
