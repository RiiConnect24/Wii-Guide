## Joining split files

If you dumped the disc on a FAT32 formatted, device, you should've got at least 2 files that end with `.partX.iso`. They need to be joined up.
{: .notice--info}

## Windows

1. Copy all the files that share the same name and end with `.partX.iso` into an empty folder on your computer.
1. Open the folder in File Explorer.
1. While holding Shift, right click on an empty space within the folder.
1. Select "Open PowerShell window here".
1. In the new window that appears, type `cmd` and press enter.
1. Finally, type `copy /b *.part?.iso game.iso` and press enter.
1. Wait until it finishes. You can confirm this when "1 file(s) copied." appears.

## macOS/Linux

1.  Copy all the files that share the same name and end with `.partX.iso` in a folder on your computer.
1.  Open up a Terminal.
1.  Use the `cd <path>` command and replace `<path>` by the path to your `.partX.iso` files.
1.  Use the following command as is: `cat \*.part?.iso > game.iso`.

To organize the games on your drive properly, you'll need to use [Wii Backup Manager](wiibackupmanager).
