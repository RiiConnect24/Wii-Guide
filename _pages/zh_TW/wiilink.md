#### 操作說明

##### Section I - Patching WADs

[If you want to see detailed instructions on how to install the WADs, click here!](wiimodlite)
{: .notice--info}

1. Download the required files based on your OS. On Windows, run `WiiLinkPatcher.bat`. On Unix systems, launch terminal and type sh, then drag the `WiiLinkPatcher.sh` into the terminal and press enter.
2. Press 1 to choose "`Start`" and confirm your selection by pressing `ENTER`.
3. For this guide, choose "`Install WiiLink on your Wii`"
4. Follow the on screen instructions to select which versions of the available channels you would like.
5. Connect the SD Card or USB Drive to your computer and select "`1`".
6. If your device was detected successfully, select "`1`". If not, make sure there's a folder called `apps` on your SD Card or USB Device and try again.
7. Be patient...
8. Once it's done, you can safely close the patcher. All of the files are ready on your SD Card.
9. If it did not copy everything automatically to your SD Card or USB Device, copy the `WAD` and `apps` folder next to `WiiLinkPatcher.bat` to your SD Card or USB Device.
10. Put your SD card or USB drive in your Wii.
11. Launch the Homebrew Channel on your Wii.
12. Launch Wii Mod Lite.
13. Using the +Control Pad on your Wii Remote, navigate to `WAD Manager`, and then navigate to the `wad` folder.
14. If your Wii is not a Japanese region, install `WiiLink_SPD(Wii).wad` or `WiiLink_SPD(vWii).wad`(Depending on console) before anything else. This is required so that we know your email address to send files.
15. Highlight all other WADs with `WiiLink` in the name, and press + to select them. When all of them are selected, press A twice to install the WADs.
16. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.
