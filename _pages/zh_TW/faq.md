### How risky is hacking my console?
Bricks (a state where either some parts of your Wii software are not working, or your Wii is not working at all) are extremely rare unless you ignore/circumvent all safety checks, or do something risky or naive like installing an older version of the Wii Menu. Make sure you install [BootMii](bootmii) and [Priiloader](priiloader) to protect yourself from bricks!

### Where should I go for support?
You can join [the RiiConnect24 Discord server](https://discord.gg/rc24) (recommended) or [e-mail us at support@riiconnect24.net](mailto:support@riiconnect24.net) for assistance.

### What are the SD card requirements and/or recommendations?
You will need an SD card with at least 128MB to run an exploit.

- If you are using the BlueBomb, str2hax, or FlashHax exploits, you do not need an SD card.

To store homebrew applications, we recommend an SD card with at least 2 GB.

* Installing BootMii.
* Failure during the install of crucial system/IOS titles (e.g. power outage).
