Wii Backup Manager is a program to copy Wii games from your computer to a USB drive so you can play the games on your Wii. It also can download game covers from [GameTDB](https://gametdb.com/) and can be used to list what games you have. This tutorial will tell you how to copy over games from your computer to your USB drive. The other features are able to be used in the easy-to-use interface.
#### What you need

* A PC running Windows
* A USB drive or SD card
* [Wii Backup Manager](https://static.wiidatabase.de/Wii-Backup-Manager.zip)


We recommend you copy games over with [Witgui](https://desairem.com/wordpress/category/witgui-download/) if you use macOS, or [Wii Backup Fusion](https://github.com/larsenv/Wii-Backup-Fusion) for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Wii Backup Manager is only compatible with Windows.

For storing multiple games, we recommend an external hard drive for your Wii. We will refer to it as a "USB drive" in this guide. Most of those found on the market should work fine.

A flash drive is not recommended, as they are small and may vary in behavior even between the same product. <br> As an alternative, you may simply use an SD card, but the Wii's SD card slot is slow.
{: .notice--info}

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32. Do not format it as other types such as exFAT, extFS. <br> You may format it as NTFS, but it won't work with a majority of apps (eg. The Homebrew Channel, Nintendont)
