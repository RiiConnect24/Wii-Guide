##### Section II - ntrboot

  + On old 2DS, you should instead enable the sleep mode switch

1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

##### Section III - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all safety checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, force your device to power off by holding down the power button
  + Your device will only boot to the SafeB9SInstaller screen until the next section is completed

##### Section IV - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Εισάγετε την κάρτα SD στον υπολογιστή σας
1. Delete `boot.firm` from the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.7z` to the root of your SD card
