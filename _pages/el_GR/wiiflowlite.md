This is a quick start guide on how to use WiiFlow Lite, a USB loader for the Wii that's used to play games from a USB drive or SD Card.

#### Τι χρειάζεστε

* A Wii
* A USB drive
* [WiiFlow Lite](https://github.com/Fledge68/WiiFlow_Lite/releases)

Make sure you have installed [cIOS](/cios) before following this!
{: .notice--info}

We recommend you copy games over with [Wii Backup Manager](/wiibackupmanager) if you use Windows, or [Witgui](https://desairem.com/wordpress/category/witgui-download/) if you use macOS.

To play multiple games, we recommend a USB-powered external hard drive for your Wii. We will refer to it as a "USB drive" in this guide. Most of the ones you can find on the market should work fine if they have USB 2 backwards compatibility. Drives with 1 TB or more in capacity will work. A flash drive and SD Card will also work, but due to the size of a flash drive and SD Card, it won't be able to store as many games.

Unlike USB Loader GX, WiiFlow Lite can load games of an SD Card.

Make sure your USB drive and/or SD Card is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS. Do not format it as other types such as exFAT, extFS, or WBFS, the latter is an old format of storing Wii games.
