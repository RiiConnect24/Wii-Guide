## What is "homebrew"?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)) refers to software not authorized by Nintendo. This can include games, utilities, emulators and much more!

Running homebrew on your Nintendo Wii can be done for free by exploiting bugs in Wii's software. The modifications installed by following this guide will give you easy and persistent access to Wii homebrew.
