## What is "homebrew"?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.

In most cases, running homebrew on your device is 100% free using the LetterBomb or Wilbrand exploit. There are also various other exploits in commercial games and the browser to get homebrew running.

## What can I do with homebrew?

Here's a list of things you can do with it. Our guide is meant for you to easily get started (and install [RiiConnect24](riiconnect24) and [Wiimmfi](wiimmfi), but we have links associated with the things on the list to help you get started.
