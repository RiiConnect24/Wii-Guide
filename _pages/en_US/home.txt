## What is "homebrew"?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) refers to unofficial software for your Wii. It allows you to run homebrew games and programs, including emulators and tools, as well as using homebrew services.

Running homebrew on your device is 100% free using the str2hax, LetterBomb or FlashHax exploits. There are also various other exploits in commercial games to get homebrew running.

## What can I do with homebrew?

Here's a list of things you can do with it. Our guide is meant for you to easily get started, but we have links associated with the things on the list to help you get started.
