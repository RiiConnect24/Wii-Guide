Just Dance has downloadable songs that you were able to buy and download when the Wii Shop Channel was up. Back in the day, people would download the song they wanted and install it, and then they could get whatever song they wanted for Wii Points which were Nintendo’s Wii Shop Channel Currency. Since the Wii Shop Channel closed, this is no longer possible. There is a new way to install song DLC, follow this tutorial to do so.

This process is different from installing a Virtual Console title or a WiiWare game. Instead of installing the WAD on your Wii (which will not work), we will use a tool called RiiConnect24 Patcher which has a built-in WAD installer which will convert the WAD to a format you can install directly to the SD Card.

Please follow the instructions carefully. It takes around 5 to 30 mins depending on what DLC you are installing.

#### Requirements
* A computer (a Windows computer is needed)
* A WAD Manager (Wii Mod Lite is recommended: https://github.com/RiiConnect24/Wii-Mod-Lite/releases/latest)
* An SD card (8GB SD card for installing Just Dance 2 to 4 DLCs, or a 32GB one for installing every Just Dance DLC). If your PC does not have a Micro SD/SD card slot, you will need an adapter.
* RiiConnect24 Patcher (https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-Patcher/releases)

#### Instructions
##### Section I - Downloading/Installing

Go to [MarioCubes repo](https://repo.mariocube.com/WADs/!Rock%20Band,%20Just%20Dance,%20&%20Guitar%20Hero%20DLC/) and select Big WADs or Split WADs and download them 

“Big WADs” contain WADs with all the DLC, but they are large. For Rock Band, these come in multiple parts. If you want to use the big WADs, make sure you have enough storage space on your SD Card.

“Split WADs” contain WADs with individual songs. This is good because you can pick and choose what WADs you want to install.


##### Section II - Installing WADs onto the SD Card

1. Download the latest release of RiiConnect24 Patcher and open it.
2. Press 1 (Start) and let it check for updates.
3. Once it has checked for updates press 1 (Wii).
4. Press 3 (Install WAD Files directly to my SD Card).
5. FYI: You will need to dump the Keys for your Wii.
6. Press 1 (Connected) and press 2 (Change Drive Letter) and type in the SD Card’s drive letter.
7. Press 1 (Continue) and let it download xyzzy-mod.
8. Unplug the SD Card out of the computer or the adapter and plug the SD Card into your Wii.
9. Launch the xyzzy-mod from the Homebrew Channel and let it dump some keys.
10. Once it's done, turn off your Wii and remove the SD card. Then, put it back into your computer or adapter.
11.Press 1 (Yes, the SD Card is connected).
12. Place all of the DLC into the wad2bin folder and press 1 (Install WAD Files onto your SD Card).
13. This process may take a while. Even though it may seem like the patcher has hung, it is still installing the DLC files. Do not close the program or you may corrupt the DLC files.
14. Once it's complete, close the app and safely remove the SD card. Then, insert the SD card into your Wii.
15. Launch your favorite Just Dance game and wait for it to detect the SD card. Once it has detected the SD card, all of the DLC songs will be added to the song list.

##### Section III - Installing cIOS

You do not need to do this if you’re using a USB Loader. For each IOS listed here (IOS56 and IOS57), if you patched them once you don’t need to patch them again.

1. Launch Wii Mod Lite from the Homebrew Channel.
2. Go to the IOSs menu.
3. Select the IOS corresponding to your game.
 (If you want to use DLC with Just Dance 2-4 select IOS56.)
 (If you want to use DLC with Just Dance 2014-2015, select IOS57.)
 (Just Dance 2014-2015 is known to have some strange issues where the DLC doesn’t work. We have managed to get it to work on USB Loaders.) 
4. Press the A Button.
5. Select Install IOS.
6. Select the revision corresponding to your IOS.
 (If you selected IOS56, select 5662.)
 (If you selected IOS57, select 5919.)
7. Press the A Button twice.
8. Press Right on the +Control Pad.
9. Press Down on the +Control Pad.
10. Press Right on the +Control Pad again.
11. Press the A Button.
12. Select Download IOS from NUS.
13. Wait for it to finish. When it’s done, after a few seconds you will be sent to the previous menu. (If you get a screen saying “Exception DSI Occurred!”, try this process again.)
14. Exit Wii Mod Lite by pressing the HOME Button.

#### Section IV - Fixing the The License error on Just Dance 2 and 3

You do need to do this if you are installing DLC for Just Dance 4 or later but this for people who get this Error message on Just Dance 2 and 3  "The license for the catalog has been deleted from the Wii System Memory. To use add-on content, re-download a content for which the license has been previously purchased"

1. Launch Wii Mod Lite and go to WADs
2. Go to your SD card.
3. Select the Bogus WAD for Just Dance 2.
4. Install it.
5. Ignore any errors that may occur.
6. Repeat steps 2-4 for Just Dance 3.
7. Launch Just Dance 2 or 3 and the DLC will show up.

You have now installed DLCs for Just Dance 2 to 2015.
