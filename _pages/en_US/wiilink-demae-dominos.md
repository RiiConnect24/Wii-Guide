{: .notice--info}

You no longer need to pay $1 to get and use Food Delivery Channel (Domino's). It's now completely _free_!
{: .notice--info}

As this service places an order to Domino's Pizza, payment is required at the door. This is usually in the form of cash, although credit/debit card machines are possible if the delivery person has one.
{: .notice--info}

Currently, only the USA and Canada are supported.
{: .notice--warning}

You cannot use the default Dolphin NAND with this service. You must use your own NAND dump. This can be done in Dolphin by going to the toolbar and clicking `Tools -> Manage NAND -> Import BootMii NAND Backup`.

Deliveroo has been discontinued as of September 19, 2023! Please do not select this option in the installer.

##### Section II - Registering your Console ID

1. After completing the setup process, go to the [WiiLink Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/reqUMqxu8D) to register your Wii's console ID.
2. Use the `Get Console ID` Homebrew app that was downloaded by the patcher to retrieve your system's console ID.
3. Visit the `#dominos-chat` channel on the Discord server.
4. Type the command `/dominos <your console ID>` in the chat, replacing `<your console ID>` with your actual console ID. Make sure the ID is in the parameter box, otherwise the command will not work and will be posted publicly on the channel.
5. Double-check that you've typed the correct console ID, as it can't be re-registered. If you need to re-register, ask a staff member in the server for assistance.
