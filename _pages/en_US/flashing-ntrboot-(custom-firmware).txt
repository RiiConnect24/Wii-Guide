title: "Flashing ntrboot (Custom Firmware)"
---

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)
{: .notice--info}

Note that the flashcart will not be able to be used for its standard functions while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it. There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot flashing instructions to remove it from your flashcart when you are done.
{: .notice--warning}

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
