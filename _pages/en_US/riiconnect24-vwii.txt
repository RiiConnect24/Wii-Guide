Guide to installing [RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz) on your vWii (Virtual Wii on Wii U) with: CMOC/MCC, Nintendo Channel, EVC and News Channel along with forced 4:3 aspect ratio patching.

Since certain features found in the original Wii are not present in the vWii,
we can only partially utilize RiiConnect24. See [what's currently
working](#whats-currently-working) for details.

#### Warnings

We are **NOT** responsible if you brick, or damage your console in any way whatsoever. If you follow this guide exactly, you shouldn't have any problems.
{: .notice--warning}

Do **NOT** perform this guide on any other console than the vWii (Virtual Wii
on Wii U). If you're looking for instructions for a Nintendo Wii, use

The following is a list of things that can potentially **BRICK** your vWii (don't do these things!):

#### What you need

* A PC or mobile device with internet access and the ability to interact with SD cards.

##### Section I - Running the patcher

Using the RiiConnect24 Patcher you should've downloaded earlier in [What you
need](#what-you-need), you will be downloading and patching IOS31, News,
Everybody Votes, Nintendo and Check Mii Out Channels for use on your vWii.

1. Run `RiiConnect24Patcher.bat` on your PC, and follow the on-screen
instructions.
2. Confirm that after running through the patcher, you have 3 folders. Either in the
same folder as `RiiConnect24Patcher.bat`, or on your SD card (depending on
what options you selected in the patcher). If they are in the same folder as
the `RiiConnect24Patcher.bat` file, move the folders to the root of your SD
card.

##### Section II - Installing the newly patched WADs

1. Follow the [Wii Mod Lite guide](wiimodlite) to install the following WAD
files that are now on your SD card:
    * `Everybody Votes Channel (REGION) (Channel) (RiiConnect24).wad`
    * `IOS31 Wii U (REGION) (RiiConnect24).wad`
    * `Mii Contest Channel (REGION) (Channel) (RiiConnect24).wad`
    * `News Channel Wii U (REGION) (Channel) (RiiConnect24).wad`
    * `Nintendo Channel (REGION) (Channel) (RiiConnect24).wad`

**NOTE**: You do not have to download Wii Mod Lite yourself, the patcher has
already downloaded it for you. It is available to launch from the **Homebrew
Channel**.
{: .notice--info}

##### Section III - Using RiiConnect24

After following the above sections, you're almost able to utilize RiiConnect24
on your Wii U. You just need to perform the following steps **after every vWii
reboot**.

1. On the vWii's **Wii Menu**, launch the **Homebrew Channel** and launch the
**ConnectMii** homebrew application.
    * This will enable the WiiConnect24 and Standby Connection flags required
      by the RiiConnect24 applications.
2. Launch the RiiConnect24 applications
* You should now be able to utilize all of the RiiConnect24 applications you
  have installed!

#### What's currently working?
The following RiiConnect24 services are **working** on the vWii:
* News Channel
    * This channel is affected by the timestamp issue. The "Last Updated" and article timestamps will be incorrect.
    * The banner data is also known to not work, returning `Unable to obtain
      data.`
* Nintendo Channel
* Everybody Votes Channel
* Check Mii Out Channel / Mii Contest Channel
{: .notice--success}

The following RiiConnect24 services are **not working** on the vWii:
* Wii Mail (most of the functionality does not exist on vWii)
    * This includes sending/receiving mail to/from friends. You can only receive global broadcast mail and posts from RSSMii feeds (if set up).
* Forecast Channel
    * This channel is affected by the timestamp issue. This is preventing the channel from getting past the loading screen, returning the `FORE000006` error.
* Everything else that isn't working according to [RiiConnect24 stats](https://rc24.xyz/stats/index.html).
