#### Instructions

##### Section I - Downloading

Your Wii must be modded in order to perform this. If it isn't, then it's best to follow [the guide](get-started) first before doing this.
{: .notice--info}

To protect against bricks, [make sure you install Priiloader](priiloader). Also, install [BootMii](bootmii) (as Boot2 if you have an early Wii, otherwise IOS). Installing brick protection along with following the guide correctly should keep you safe from bricks. DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL YOU HAVE INSTALLED PRIILOADER AND BOOTMII!
