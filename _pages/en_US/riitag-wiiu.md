RiiTag is a customizable and dynamic gamertag. By sharing your gamertag (a dynamic image), you can show what you've been playing to your friends! You launch a plugin on your Wii U console via Aroma, and the tag updates on-the-fly.

#### What you need

- A device capable of interacting with SD cards
- Softmodded Wii U console with Aroma custom firmware
  - If you have not softmodded your Wii U yet, [please do so](https://wiiu.hacks.guide). You cannot proceed without.
- A Discord account
- The latest release of the [UTag plugin](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/UTag/releases)

Previously, UTag allowed using other custom firmware (often abbreviated as CFW), but the only supported custom firmware, and the only one you should be using, is Aroma.

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Website instructions

1. Go to the [RiiTag website](https://tag.rc24.xyz/).
2. Click `Log In` and log in with your Discord account.
3. A dialog will pop up asking you if you want to authorize `RiiConnect24 Login` with Discord. Click `Authorize`.
4. Click `Edit Your Tag` and customize it to how you like. You can add a background, overlay, flag, nickname, Wii Number, and manually enter in games to show on your tag (not needed if you're using a USB Loader).
5. Click `Show Key` and make note of the key shown. This will be used later on in this guide.
6. Click `Submit` to save your changes.

Do not share your RiiTag key with anyone! If you do, people can abuse your tag.

##### Section II - Setting things up on the SD card

1. Extract the UTag file to `/wiiu/environments/aroma/plugins` on your SD card. If it doesn't exist, create it.
2. In `/wiiu/` on your SD card, create a file called `utag.txt` and paste your RiiTag key from the previous step into it.

##### Section III - Running the plugin

You don't need to manually run the plugin - just run Aroma and it will automatically be loaded. We recommend setting up Aroma for coldbooting so the plugin gets loaded automatically when you boot the console.
