title: "Flashing ntrboot (DSi)"

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

This method requires temporary access to a Nintendo DSi that is compatible with your flashcart.

Note that more recent DSi versions have blocked access to some flashcarts. This leaves them unable to launch the flasher `.nds` file on newer versions. The ntrboot compatible flashcarts are able to launch `.nds` files under the following versions:

  + [R4i Gold 3DS RTS](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149) : <= 1.4.5
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160) : <= 1.4.4
  + R4i Gold 3DS "Starter" : <= 1.4.5
  + R4i Ultra : <= 1.4.1
  + Infinity 3 R4i : <= 1.4.5

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
