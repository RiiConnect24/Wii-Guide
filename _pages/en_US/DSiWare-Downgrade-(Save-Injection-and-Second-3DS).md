**They are only useful if you already own "Fieldrunners", "Legends of Exidia", "Guitar Rock Tour", or "The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords (Anniversary Edition)" on the source 3DS. Each game has been pulled from the eShop; you must have already gotten them.**
{: .notice--primary}

If you are between versions 11.0.0 and 11.2.0, you can follow this guide to downgrade your NATIVE_FIRM using DSiWare and a second 3DS which has already has a Custom Firmware installed on it in order to dump and restore your NAND.
{: .notice}

If you are below 11.2.0 on either device, then you should do the ctr-httpwn steps (when prompted) on each device under 11.2.0 to allow you to System Transfer with them.
{: .notice--info}

This takes advantage of an oversight which allows DSiWare titles to read and write anywhere in NAND.
{: .notice--info}

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).
{: .notice--info}

This guide will assume the CFW 3DS is running arm9loaderhax and was setup with this guide, but will work (with slight modifications such as doing all SysNAND steps on EmuNAND) on systems running an EmuNAND. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).
{: .notice--info}

Your DSiWare's save will be backed up before getting replaced by the hacked save.
{: .notice--info}

{% capture notice-4 %}
This exploit requires you to [System Transfer](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13996/) from a CFW 3DS to a stock 3DS as part of the steps. System Transfers will work in the following directions *only*:    
  + New 3DS -> New 3DS    
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> Old 3DS or 2DS    
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> New 3DS    
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--warning">{{ notice-4 | markdownify }}</div>

Both systems MUST be from the same region.
{: .notice--warning}

**The _target 3DS_ will have all of its data erased!**
{: .notice--danger}

The source 3DS's NNID will be stuck on the target 3DS unless you either system transfer back or call Nintendo! (details in the instructions)
{: .notice--danger}

System Transfers can only be performed once a week.
{: .notice--danger}

  + **The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords (Anniversary Edition)**: Just start the game
  + If your game has an error about `boot.nds` or a white screen, **then the exploit has been successful**
  + If your game behaves normally and does not give you this error, then you should stop and figure out what went wrong
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#twl_broken)

##### Section IV - ctr-httpwn

**This section is only required if _the target 3DS_ is under 11.2.0.**

**This will allow you to system transfer on versions other than the latest.**

1. Copy and merge the `3ds` folder from the ctr-httpwn `.zip` to **the target 3DS**'s SD card
2. Reinsert your SD card into **the target 3DS**
2. Launch the homebrew launcher on the device using [Homebrew Launcher (No Browser)](homebrew-launcher-(no-browser))
  + **New 3DSs on versions 10.7.0 and 11.0.0 can use [Homebrew Launcher (Browser)](homebrew-launcher-(browser)) instead**
  + **Ensure menuhax is not installed, or you won't be able to return to Home Menu from the homebrew launcher**
3. Launch ctr-httpwn on **the target 3DS**
4. Press (A) to continue
5. Press (Start) to exit ctr-httpwn
6. Press (Start) to open the homebrew launcher exit menu
7. Press (X) to Return to Home Menu (no reboot)
  + You may get an "Error has occurred" message with the option to continue. This is fine, just hit (A)
8. Continue to the next section **without rebooting**
  + **the target 3DS** has been temporarily patched to allow network functions (such as System Transfer) without running the latest system version
  + Keep in mind that exiting the System Settings will reboot the system
  + If the system is rebooted, you'll have to re-run ctr-httpwn before System Transfer will work

##### Section V - System Transfer

1. **Backup every file on both 3DS's SD cards to two separate folders on your computer (keep track of which is which)!**
2. Reinsert each SD card back into their corresponding 3DS
4. If **the target 3DS** has a Nintendo Network ID on it, you must format the device using System Settings:
  + Go to the last page of "Other Settings" and select "Format System Memory", then follow all instructions
5. Read the following:
  + Your CFW 3DS = the source 3DS = "Source System"
  + Your Stock 3DS = the target 3DS = "Target System"
  + **Move DSiWare titles if prompted!**
  + Do **NOT** delete the source system's SD card contents if prompted
  + Make sure neither device's battery dies during the transfer
  + 2DS/Old 3DS (source) to New 3DS (target) only - if asked which method you wish to use to transfer the SD card data:
    + **Do NOT** choose the "Low-Capacity microSD Card Transfer" or minimal option (option 2), it will only transfer tickets and likely will not transfer the DSiWare save.
    + Fast Method: If you have the ability to move the data from the SD card (source) to the microSD card (target), when prompted use the "PC-Based Transfer" option (option 3).
    + Slowest Method: If you don't have the ability to move the data on a PC use the **full** "Wireless Transfer" option (option 1).
6. Go to [this link](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/227/) and follow Nintendo's official instructions for System Transferring from one system to another while keeping in mind what you just read

##### Section VI - Restoring the source 3DS

1. On **the source 3DS**, complete initial setup
2. Do one of the following *(or neither if you don't mind __the source 3DS__'s NNID being nonfunctional)*
    + Do the rest of the sections and then the full guide on **the target 3DS**, then wait one week, then System Transfer from **the target 3DS** back to **the source 3DS** *(remember you cannot transfer back from a New 3DS to an Old 3DS)*
    + Call Nintendo and tell them you no longer have access to the device that your NNID is linked to (which is **the target 3DS** in this case), and would like it linked to a different device (which is **the source 3DS** in this case)
3. Reboot **the source 3DS** while holding Start to launch Hourglass9
4. Go to SysNAND Backup/Restore and restore SysNAND from `NANDmin.bin`

##### Section VII - Backing up the target 3DS's NFIRM

1. Copy the dgTool `boot.nds` to the root of **the target 3DS**'s SD card
