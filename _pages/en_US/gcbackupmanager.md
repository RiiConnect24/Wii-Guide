GameCube Backup Manager is a convenient PC software that simplifies the process of transferring GameCube games to your USB drive or SD Card. It functions similar to the popular tool called [Wii Backup Manager](wiibackupmanager), allowing you to easily manage and organize your GameCube game backups. With this program, you can effortlessly copy your favorite GameCube games onto portable storage devices, making them readily accessible for future gaming sessions.

#### What you need

- An SD card or USB drive

To play multiple games, it is recommended to use an external hard drive for your Wii. Any external hard drive found on most modern marketplaces should work with your Wii.

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32. Do not format it as other types such as NTFS, exFAT, extFS, or WBFS, the latter being an outdated filesystem for storing Wii games.

3. Click on the `Files (Destination)` tab, then select the `Inactive` option from the dropdown menu. This will allow you to choose the drive where you want to transfer the game. Select the appropriate drive letter from the list.
