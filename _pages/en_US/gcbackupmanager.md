GameCube Backup Manager is a convenient PC software that simplifies the process of transferring GameCube games to your USB drive or SD Card. It functions similar to the popular tool called [Wii Backup Manager](wiibackupmanager), allowing you to easily manage and organize your GameCube game backups. With this program, you can effortlessly copy your favorite GameCube games onto portable storage devices, making them readily accessible for future gaming sessions.
#### What you need

* A USB drive/SD card
* [GameCube Backup Manager](https://github.com/AxionDrak/GameCube-Backup-Manager/releases)

To play multiple games, we recommend a USB-powered external hard drive for your Wii. We will refer to it as a "USB drive" in this guide. Most of the ones you can find on the market should work fine if they have USB 2 backwards compatibility. Drives with 1 TB or more in capacity will work.

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32. Do not format it as other types such as NTFS, exFAT, extFS, or WBFS, the latter is only for storing Wii games.
