## What is "homebrew"?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)) refers to software not authorized by Nintendo. This can include games, utilities, emulators and much more!

Running homebrew on your Nintendo Wii can be done for free by exploiting bugs in Wii's software. The modifications installed by following this guide will give you easy and persistent access to Wii homebrew.

## What can I do with homebrew?

Here's a list of things you can do using homebrew. While this list is by no means totally comprehensive, you should have a good idea of what is possible, and the guide will help you easily get started.

- Patch game disc contents (allowing you to load game modifications) using [Riivolution](http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Riivolution).
- Install themes to your Wii Menu using [MyMenuify](themes).
- Install a USB Loader like [WiiFlow](wiiflow) or [USB Loader GX](usbloadergx) to launch all your favorite titles from a USB storage device and more.
