If you didn't install BootMii nor don't have a NAND backup, please install it and do a backup. You cannot restore a NAND backup from a USB.
{: .notice--warning}

Wii consoles with no GameCube controller ports CANNOT RECOVER from a NAND backup. This is because recovering from a NAND backup while having BootMii as IOS is dangerous.
