This is a quick start guide on how to use WiiFlow, a USB loader for the Wii that's used to play games from a USB drive or SD card.

#### What you need

- A Wii
- A USB drive and/or SD card
- [WiiFlow Lite](https://oscwii.org/library/app/wiiflow)

Make sure you have installed [cIOS](/cios) before following this!
{: .notice--info}

We recommend you copy games over with [Wii Backup Manager](/wiibackupmanager) if you use Windows, [Witgui](https://desairem.com/wordpress/category/witgui-download/) if you use macOS, or [Wii Backup Fusion](https://github.com/larsenv/Wii-Backup-Fusion) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

If you want to play games that are in NKit format, use [this program](https://gbatemp.net/download/nkit.36157/) to convert them to ISO first.
{: .notice--info}

If you are not copying games using Wii Backup Manager, Witgui, or Wii Backup Fusion, make a folder on the root of the USB drive or SD card named "wbfs" and put the games in there.

To play games, we recommend using an external hard drive for your Wii. Flash drives are not recommended, and may vary in behavior even between the same product.
{: .notice--info}

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32. Do not format it as other types such as exFAT or extFS. <br>
You may format it as NTFS, but it won't work with a majority of apps (eg. The Homebrew Channel, Nintendont)

##### Getting Started

This is not a full comprehensive guide on using WiiFlow. This is intended to help you learn how to use it, by giving you a quick start. You should be able to figure out all the great features of WiiFlow by using it.

- WiiFlow by default is set to only find games on the SD card. This can be changed by going in to settings, startup settings then turn off "Mount SD Only".
- You can toggle between viewing Wii games, GameCube games, Wii Channels, Plugins, Homebrew apps by clicking the button second to last button on the right.
- You can download game covers by going to "Settings" then "Download Covers and Banners"
- If you don't have an internet connection, you can manually download the covers by following this guide [here](Offline-Covers).<br>

##### User Interface

When WiiFlow detects games, they are displayed in flow view. When you click on a game you are given these options:

- Star - Adds game to favorites.
- Bookshelf - Adds the game to 1 of 6 categories of your choosing.
