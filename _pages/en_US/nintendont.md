This is a quick start guide on how to use Nintendont, a popular GameCube Game Loader for the Wii that's used to play games from a USB drive or SD card.

#### What you need

* A Wii
* A USB drive or SD Card
* [Nintendont](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/hbb/Nintendont/Nintendont.zip)

We recommend you copy games over with [GameCube Backup Manager](https://github.com/AxionDrak/GameCube-Backup-Manager/releases) if you use Windows.

To play games, we recommend using an external hard drive for your Wii. Flash drives should be usable too, however, flash drives are known to be problematic with Nintendont. SD cards are fine, but they will be slow.

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32. Do not format it as other types such as exFAT, extFS, WBFS or NTFS.

#### Instructions

##### Downloading

1. Extract Nintendont and put it in the `apps` folder on your USB drive or SD card.
2. Insert your USB drive, or SD card if you're using one, into your Wii and launch Nintendont from the Homebrew Channel.

##### Getting Started

There is no "guide" to use the Nintendont app. This is intended to help you learn how to use it, by giving you a quick start. You should be able to figure out all the great features of Nintendont by using it.

###### Key Features

- You can also play your game discs right from your disc drive.
- You can use a Wiimote & Nunchuk to play your games, but you will need to use a Classic Controller or a Wii U Pro Controller to use all of the game's features.
- You can also use many other USB or Bluetooth controllers. Read more [here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/nintendont.349258/#Controllers).
- You can use a USB keyboard to enter text in games that require it.
- You can use a fan-made patch to enable online play in some games.
- You can [emulate the BBA adapter](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont/blob/master/BBA_Readme.md) to play LAN mode on games that support it.
- You can use USB Loader GX or WiiFlow as a front-end for Nintendont.
