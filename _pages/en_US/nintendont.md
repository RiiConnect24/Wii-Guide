This is a quick start guide on how to use Nintendont, a popular USB loader for the Wii that's used to play games from a USB drive.

#### What you need

* A Wii
* A USB drive
* [Nintendont](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/hbb/Nintendont/Nintendont.zip)

We recommend you copy games over with [GameCube Backup Manager](https://github.com/AxionDrak/GameCube-Backup-Manager/releases) if you use Windows.

To play games, we recommend using an external hard drive for your Wii. Flash drives should be usable too, but external hard drives are recommended as they are more reliable, and can store more games.

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS. Do not format it as other types such as exFAT, extFS, or WBFS, the latter is an old format of storing GameCube games.

#### Instructions

##### Downloading

1. Extract Nintendont and put it in the `apps` folder on your USB drive or SD card.
2. Insert your USB drive, and SD card if you're using one, into your Wii and launch Nintendont from the Homebrew Channel.

##### Getting Started

There is no "guide" to use the Nintendont app. This is intended to help you learn how to use it, by giving you a quick start. You should be able to figure out all the great features of USB Loader GX by using it.
