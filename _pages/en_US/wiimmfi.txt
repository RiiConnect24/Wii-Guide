Wiimmfi is a replacement service for the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

[Wiimmfi's site is here.](https://wiimmfi.de/)

## Homebrew (Disc) Application
MrBean35000vr (creator of CTGP-R, a Mario Kart Wii content pack) created a Wiimmfi Disc Patcher that allows you to insert a disc and patch the game on-the-fly for Wiimmfi use, though this must be run every time you start the disc.

#### What you need
* An SD card.
* Homebrew Channel (you should already have this installed)
* [Auto Wiimmfi Patcher](/assets/files/autowiimmfipatcher0.4.zip)

#### Instructions

1. Extract Auto Wiimmfi Patcher and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD Card.
1. Insert your SD Card into your Wii, and launch Auto Wiimmfi Patcher from the Homebrew Channel.
1. Insert your game disc (you can insert it before or after launch, it doesn't matter).
1. Wait for patch to complete, and it'll begin!

## ISO Patching
You may not want to run a patcher each time you want to play on Wiimmfi, and maybe you already use a USB Loader. As such, ISO Patchers were created, some for specific games.

#### What you need
* Your copy of your game (WBFS, ISO, cISO, and other forms that a Wii can use are supported).
* Wiimm's Disc Patcher: You need [this](http://download.wiimm.de/wiimmfi/patcher/mkw-wiimmfi-patcher-v3.7z) one if you're patching Mario Kart Wii, [this](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/ACW-Patcher/releases) one if you are patching Animal Crossing Wii, or [this](http://download.wiimm.de/wiimmfi/patcher/wiimmfi-patcher-v3.7z) one for other Wii games such as Super Smash Bros: Brawl.
* A USB Loader, cIOS, and a USB to store the game on (you should already have these if you're using a USB Loader)

#### Instructions
1. Extract the patcher of your choise to a folder, and place your copy of the game in it.
1. Run the patch script for your OS: usually it will end in `.bat` for Windows and `.sh` for Mac/Linux.
1. Once it's finished, get the version out of the `wiimmfi-images` folder (it may be in the folder before the patcher - ../wiimmfi-images) and copy it back to your USB.

## On the Fly Patching
Instead of patching the ISO you can use a USB loader which supports Wiimmfi.

#### What you need
* Your copy of your game on your USB.
* A USB loader which supports setting a Private WFC server like [USB Loader GX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbloadergx/).

#### Instructions (for USB Loader GX)
1. On the loader's main screen, go to Settings (the gear icon).
1. Select Loader settings.
1. Search "Private Server" and change it to Wiimmfi.de.

## WiiWare Patching
You can patch WiiWare games in order to play them on Wiimmfi.

#### What you need

- Your copy of your game (in WAD format).
- [Auto WiiWare Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/auto-wiiware-patcher/releases)
- [Wii Mod Lite](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/Wii-Mod-Lite/releases)

Steps:
1. Extract the .zip of the latest version of Auto WiiWare Patcher, and put your WAD in it.
1. Run the patch script for your OS: usually it will end in `.bat` for Windows and `.sh` for Mac/Linux.
1. If it completed successfully, install the WAD that was made in `wiiware-wads` with Wii Mod Lite.

## Mario Kart Wii Competitions
Wiimmfi allows you to participate in Mario Kart Wii competitions again.

#### What you need
* Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher [Wii](https://competitions.wiimmfi.de/competition-tool-wii.zip) / [Wii U (vWii)](https://competitions.wiimmfi.de/competition-tool-wiiu.zip)

#### Instructions (for Wii)

1. Extract Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD Card.
1. Insert your SD Card into the Wii.
1. Launch the original Mario Kart Wii game (not Wiimmfi patched).
1. Navigate to Settings -> Network Settings (or Nintendo WFC Connection) -> Message Service. If you turned the message service feature on, turn it off and turn it on again.
1. Launch Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher.
1. The patcher will look for save files for Mario Kart Wii on your storage device in various places, and upload them. This is done in case a missing competition is found in your save file. It will also, of course, patch your Wii for competitions.

If you're using the Wii U, you will have to run the competitions patcher whenever you want to check for a competition, because WiiConnect24 is not enabled on the Wii U.
