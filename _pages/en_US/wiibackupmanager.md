Wii Backup Manager is a program to copy Wii games from your computer to a USB drive so you can play the games on your Wii. It also can download game covers from [GameTDB](https://gametdb.com/) and can be used to list what games you have. This tutorial will tell you how to copy over games from your computer to your USB drive. The other features are able to be used in the easy-to-use interface.
#### What you need

* A USB drive

We recommend you use Witgui if you use macOS. Wii Backup Manager doesn't work on macOS.

To play multiple games, we recommend a USB-powered external hard drive for your Wii. We will refer to it as a "USB drive" in this guide. Most of the ones you can find on the market should work fine if they have USB 2 backwards compatibility. Drives with 1 TB or more in capacity will work. A flash drive will also work, but due to the size of a flash drive, it won't be able to store as many games.

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS. Do not format it as other types such as extFS or WBFS, the latter is an old format of storing Wii games.
