[RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz/) allows you to use the News or Forecast Channel, exchange mail between Wiis and PC, vote on polls, and other WiiConnect24 features. It replaces the built-in WiiConnect24 system.

As it stands, RiiConnect24 does not support the Wii U yet, so please do not install it on a Wii U yet.
<br>
So far only the News, Forecast, and Everybody Votes Channels work, but check [the stats page](https://rc24.xyz/stats/index.html) for further developments.
{: .notice--warning}

In order to install RiiConnect24 you must be on Wii Menu version 4.3, otherwise mail will not work.
