The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provides brick protection.

#### Instruksjoner

1. You will see a scam warning screen. Wait 30 seconds for the text "Press 1 to continue" to appear, then press 1. ![Scam Screen](/images/Wii/ScamScreen.png)

2. When at the HackMii installer, you are able to install the Homebrew Channel and BootMii. ![Results](/images/Wii/Results.png)

4. Press Continue when finished. ![Success Installing the Homebrew Channel](/images/Wii/SuccessHBC.png)

5. Once installed, press back and go to BootMii.
6. If the main screen says you can install BootMii as boot2, do so. This offers the best possible brick protection you can have.
7. If you cannot install BootMii as boot2 (like the Wii shown in step two), install BootMii as IOS instead. While this doesn't give you any brick protection, you will still be able to make a NAND backup.

If you do not have an SD card, you cannot install or use BootMii, and therefore will not be able utilize any of the mentioned benefits. You can always install it at a later date.
