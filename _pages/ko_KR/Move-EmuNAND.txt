This is an add-on section for moving the contents of a previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, then removing the old EmuNAND partition. EmuNAND와 RedNAND는 [동일한 개념](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection)을 다른 방식으로 구현한 것입니다.
{: .notice--info}

**이 작업을 진행하기 위해서는 arm9loaderhax + Luma3DS가 설치되어 있어야 합니다.**
{: .notice--danger}

#### 준비물

* 설치된 EmuNAND
* 최신 버전의 [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest)

#### 진행 방법

##### 섹션 I - 준비 작업

1. Power off your device
1. SD 카드를 컴퓨터에 삽입하세요.
1. Copy `GodMode9.bin` from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card and rename `GodMode9.bin` in `/luma/payloads/` to `start_GodMode9.bin`
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device

##### Section II - Backup SysNAND DSiWare Saves

If you do not have any DSiWare games or saves that you care about, skip this section.
{: .notice--info}

1. Launch GodMode9 from arm9loaderhax by holding (Start) on boot
1. Navigate to `SYSNAND TWLN` -> `title`
1. Hold (R) and press (A) at the same time on `00030004` to select the folder, then select "Copy to 0:/gm9out"
  + This process may take some time if you have many DSiWare games
1. Press (B) twice to return to the main menu

##### Section III - Backup GBA VCs Saves

If you do not have any GBA VC games or saves that you care about, skip this section.

1. Create a folder in `/files9/` for each GBA VC game that you want to backup the save for 
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device into SysNAND
1. Do the following process for each GBA VC game that you want to backup the save for:
  + Launch the GBA VC game on SysNAND
  + Exit the GBA VC game
  + Reboot holding (Start) during boot to launch GodMode9
