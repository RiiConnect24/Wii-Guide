Our official DNS Address has been updated. We require all users to change it. Failure in doing so will result in losing access to most or every RiiConnect24 service.

The old address will be supported until it's `DEPRECATION` date. We will remind you using Wii Mail or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rc24) about the need to change the DNS Address in the next few months.

We've restricted access to Forecast Channel and News Channel for users still using the old DNS Address. Users will also see a new EULA when trying to enable WiiConnect24 reminding them about the change. ![The notification on the EULA confirmation screen.](/images/eula_change_dns_notification.png) ![The notification on the Forecast Channel](/images/forecast_change_dns_notification.png) ![The notification on the News Channel](/images/news_channel_change_dns_notification.png)

To update your entered DNS Address please follow these steps:

1. `Wii 옵션`으로 이동합니다.
2. `Wii 본체 설정`으로 이동합니다.
3. `페이지 2`로 이동하고, `인터넷`을 클릭하세요.
4. Go to `Connection Settings`
5. Select your current connection
6. Go to `Change Settings`
7. `DNS 자동 연결` (IP 주소가 아님) 으로 이동해서 `끄기`를 선택하고, `고급 설정`으로 들어갑니다.
8. Type in `167.86.108.126` as the primary DNS
9. Type in `1.1.1.1` as the secondary DNS
10. Select `Confirm`, then select `Save`
11. Select `OK` to perform a connection
12. 연결 테스트가 성공했다면, Wii 업데이트를 `아니요`를 눌러 건너뜁니다.

The old DNS Server will stop working on `June 1st, 2023`.
