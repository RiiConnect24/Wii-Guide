If you have already hacked your device before and have a EmuNAND based CFW setup, this guide deals exclusively with SysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to SysNAND. EmuNAND ve RedNAND terimlerinin, birbirinden farklı uygulamalara işaret ettiğini unutmayın.[aynı konsept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

1. Launch udsploit from the list of homebrew
  + You may have to scroll down to see this option
1. Once it has completed, press (Start) to exit udsploit
  + This may take several tries
  + Eğer donarsa, konsolun kapatma tuşuna konsol kapanana kadar basın, sonra tekrar deneyin
1. Launch safehax from the list of homebrew
  + You may have to scroll down to see this option
  + If you get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, make sure you ran udsploit with Wireless Communication turned on

  + Eğer donarsa, konsolun kapatma tuşuna konsol kapanana kadar basın, sonra tekrar deneyin
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller
  + If you launch into the Luma3DS configuration menu instead of SafeB9SInstaller, power off your device and ensure that `safehaxpayload.bin` exists on the root of your SD card
