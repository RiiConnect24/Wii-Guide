title: "Move EmuNAND"
---

This is an add-on section for moving the contents of a previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, then removing the old EmuNAND partition. EmuNAND ve RedNAND terimlerinin, birbirinden farklı uygulamalara işaret ettiğini unutmayın.[aynı konsept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

Note that if you have any payload files other than `GodMode9.firm` in the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a "chainloader menu" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select "GodMode9" for these instructions.

**You MUST have already installed Luma3DS and boot9strap or arm9loaderhax to use this.**
