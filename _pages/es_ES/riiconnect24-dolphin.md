### Requisitos

* A computer with either Windows 10 or newer or any Unix-based system
* [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/)
* [RiiConnect24 Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-Patcher/releases)

#### Instrucciones

##### Sección I - Instalando Dolphin

If you have Dolphin already installed, skip to Section II
{: .notice--info}

1. Download the latest Dolphin beta version, but **not a stable version as these are very outdated!**
2. Extract the .7z file using a program like 7-Zip or WinRAR.
3. Start Dolphin.
4. In Dolphin, go to `Tools` -> `Perform Online System Update` -> Choose your region. ![Actualizar la consola por Internet](/images/Dolphin_RC24/1.jpg)

If you have a homebrewed Wii console, you can use a [BootMii NAND dump](bootmii) instead of installing the system files with the System Update option. See [this page](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=NAND_Usage_Guide) for more information.

##### Section II - Installing RiiConnect24

If you use a Windows version before Windows 10, you unfortunately cannot use WiiConnect24 inside Dolphin. You can use [this program](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/.VFF-File-Downloader-for-Dolphin) to run it instead.

4. Presiona 1 y luego Enter para comenzar. (NOTE: These screenshots are from the Windows version of the patcher.)
5. For this guide, choose "`Install RiiConnect24 on your Dolphin Emulator`" ![Install RiiConnect24](/images/RC24_Patcher/3.JPG)
6. Choose "`Express (Recommended)`". It will give you everything you need. ![Express Settings](/images/RC24_Patcher/4.JPG)
7. Select your region. ![Select your region](/images/RC24_Patcher/5.JPG)
8. While you're at it, RiiConnect24 Patcher can additionally download some other optional channels that do not use RiiConnect24. `[X]` represents the options that selected. Just press 5 and `ENTER` if you're not interested. !\[Additional optional channels\](/images/RC24_Patcher/6.JPG
9. Press `1` then `ENTER` to start patching.
10. Be patient... ![It's patching!](/images/RC24_Patcher/9.JPG)
11. After it's done, we would appreciate if you take a minute to send anonymous feedback to us.  If you don't want to, close the patcher. All the files should already be on your SD Card. ![Si el proceso ha sido exitoso,](/images/RC24_Patcher/10.JPG) ![Files copied](/images/RC24_Patcher/11.PNG)
12. In Dolphin, go to `Tools` and then `Install WAD`. Install all the WAD files one by one.
13. Unzip [AnyGlobe Changer v1.0](https://github.com/fishguy6564/AnyGlobe-Changer/releases/download/1.0/AnyGlobe.Changer.zip) and run the boot.dol file. Select your region and save. This will allow the Everybody Votes Channel to work.

Unfortunately, Wii Mail doesn't work in Dolphin yet.
{: .notice--info}

You will have to launch the Everybody Votes Channel 4 times at most in order for it to start working.
