Wilbrand, like LetterBomb, is an exploit for the Wii that is triggered using the Wii Message Board.

Unlike LetterBomb, Wilbrand supports Wii menu versions down to 3.0.
{: .notice--info}

There are two methods listed on this page used to create the proper Wilbrand exploit. Wilbrand Web is recommended for its ease of use.
{: .notice--info}

### Wilbrand Web (Recommended)

#### What you need

- An SD card formatted to FAT32/MS-DOS
- A Wii on at least version 3.0

SD cards larger than 2GB will not work on Wii menu versions before 4.0.
{: .notice--warning}

#### Instructions

1.  On your Wii, go to `Wii Settings`, and make note of the version at the top right. Proceed to `Internet` -> `Console Information` and also make note of your MAC address.
1.  Visit [wilbrand.donut.eu.org](https://wilbrand.donut.eu.org/), input your Wii MAC, version, region, ensure `Bundle the HackMii Installer for me!` is checked, and cut either wire. ![Wilbrand Web](/images/wilbrand/web.png)
1.  Click on "Download your .zip".
1.  Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP to the root of your SD card.
1.  Take out your SD card and insert it in your Wii.
    - The SD card must be inserted in the SD card slot located in the front of the Wii. Using a USB adapter plugged into the Wii's USB port will not work.
1.  On your Wii, return to the Wii Menu and then open the Wii Message Board.
1.  Load the green letter with the Bob-omb icon.
    - Ensure the date on your Wii is correct, otherwise you might be unable to find the letter.
    - The mail may have appeared on the previous or next day.
    - If you don't see the green letter, check if any errors appear in the SD card sections in `Data Management`. If any do, there may be an issue with the SD card format or the Wii's SD card reader. ![Wilbrand in its natural habitat](/images/wilbrand/msgboard.png)

If this didn't work for you, [try another exploit](get-started) or try [Wilbrand CLI](#wilbrand-cli).
