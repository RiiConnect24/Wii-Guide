RiiTag is a customizable and dynamic gamertag. By sharing your gamertag (a dynamic image), you can show what you've been playing to your friends! You connect it to a USB Loader, and the tag updates on-the-fly. You need a Discord account in order to start using RiiTag.

Want to install RiiTag on your Wii U? See [this guide](riitag-wiiu) on how to connect it to your Wii U Menu.

The steps to connect RiiTag to your USB Loader depend on what USB Loader you use.

###### WiiFlow

1. Take the SD Card or USB device where your WiiFlow data is into your computer.
