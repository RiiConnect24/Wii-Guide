RiiTag is a customizable and dynamic gamertag. By sharing your gamertag (a dynamic image), you can show what you've been playing to your friends! You launch a plugin on your Wii U console, and the tag updates on-the-fly.

#### What you need

- A device capable of interacting with SD cards
- Softmodded Wii U console
   - If you have not softmodded your Wii U yet, [please do so](https://wiiu.hacks.guide). You cannot proceed without.
- A Discord account
- The latest release of [Wii U Plugin Loader](https://github.com/Maschell/WiiUPluginLoader/releases)
- The latest release of [UTag plugin](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/UTag/releases)
- The latest release of [Flump's Coldboot Haxchi Mod](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gxkf72jia1adpyg/AACPMfGU2AyWUZmhU2awjSsca/Haxchi-CBHC%20Flump%20Mod.zip?dl=1)
   - This Coldboot Haxchi mod is used in Section IV. You do not need to download it if you can't use Coldboot Haxchi, or you do not want Wii U Plugin Loader loading on startup.

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Website instructions

1. Go to the [RiiTag website](https://tag.rc24.xyz/).
2. Click `Log In` and log in with your Discord account.
3. A dialog will pop up asking you if you want to authorize `RiiConnect24 Login` with Discord. Click `Authorize`.
4. Click `Edit Your Tag` and customize it to how you like. You can add a background, overlay, flag, nickname, Wii Number, and manually enter in games to show on your tag (not needed if you're using a USB Loader).
5. Click `Show Key` and make note of the key shown. This will be used later on in this guide.
6. Click `Submit` to save your changes.

Do not share your RiiTag key with anyone! If you do, people can abuse your tag.

##### Section II - Setting things up on the SD card

1. Extract the Wii U Plugin Loader `.zip` file to the root of your SD card.
   - You should see a folder titled `wiiupluginloader` in `/wiiu/apps/` on your SD.
2. Place the `UTag.mod` file in the `/wiiu/plugins/` folder on your SD card.
3. Create a new file titled `utag.txt` on the root of your SD card, and open it with a text editor.
4. Paste the key you made note of earlier in Step 5 of [Section I - Getting Started](#section-i---getting-started) into this `utag.txt` file, and save it.
   - We're all done with the SD card side of things.
5. Insert your SD card into your Wii U.

##### Section III - Running the plugin

1. Using your preferred method (browser exploit, Haxchi, Homebrew Launcher application, etc.), launch the **Homebrew Launcher** on your Wii U console.
2. Navigate to, and launch the homebrew application titled `Wii U Plugin Loader`.
3. You should be greeted with a menu, including a toggle for `UTag`. Enable `UTag`, and then press + on the Wii U GamePad. You should now be kicked back to the Wii U Menu.

##### Section IV - Running on startup (optional)

We will now setup Wii U Plugin Loader to run on startup with your Wii U. **This only works if you are using or willing to use Coldboot Haxchi.** You will still have to turn on UTag and press + on the Wii U GamePad to be kicked into the Wii U Menu on startup.
