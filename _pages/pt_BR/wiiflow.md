This is a quick start guide on how to use WiiFlow, a USB loader for the Wii that's used to play games from a USB drive or SD card.

#### Você precisará de

* Um Wii
* A USB drive and/or SD card
* [WiiFlow Lite](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/hbb/wiiflow/wiiflow.zip)

Make sure you have installed [cIOS](/cios) before following this!

We recommend you copy games over with [Wii Backup Manager](/wiibackupmanager) if you use Windows, [Witgui](https://desairem.com/wordpress/category/witgui-download/) if you use macOS, or [Wii Backup Fusion](https://github.com/larsenv/Wii-Backup-Fusion) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

If you want to play games that are in NKit format, use [this program](https://gbatemp.net/download/nkit.36157/) to convert them to ISO first. You can also use a development build of Dolphin, right click on a game, and use "Convert File" to convert it.

If you are not copying games using Wii Backup Manager, Witgui, or Wii Backup Fusion, make a folder on the root of the USB drive or SD card named "wbfs" and put the games in there.

To play games, we recommend using an external hard drive for your Wii. Flash drives should be usable too, but external hard drives are recommended as they are more reliable, and can store more games.

Unlike USB Loader GX, WiiFlow can load games of an SD card.

Make sure your USB drive and/or SD card is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS. Do not format it as other types such as exFAT, extFS, or WBFS, the latter is an old format of storing Wii games.
