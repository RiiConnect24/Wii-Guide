This is a quick start guide on how to use Nintendont, a popular USB loader for the Wii that's used to play games from a USB drive.

#### Você precisará de

- Um Wii
- Um cartão SD ou armazenamento USB
- [Nintendont](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/hbb/Nintendont/Nintendont.zip)

We recommend you copy games over with [GameCube Backup Manager](https://github.com/AxionDrak/GameCube-Backup-Manager/releases) if you use Windows.

To play games, we recommend using an external hard drive for your Wii. Flash drives should be usable too, but external hard drives are recommended as they are more reliable, and can store more games.

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS. Do not format it as other types such as exFAT, extFS, or WBFS, the latter is an old format of storing Wii games.
