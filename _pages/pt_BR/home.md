## What is "homebrew"?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) refers to unofficial software including games, utilities, emulators and others.

Running homebrew on your Nintendo Wii is free using the str2hax, LetterBomb or FlashHax exploits. There are also various other exploits in commercial games to get homebrew running.

## What can I do with homebrew?

Here's a list of things you can do with it. While these aren't all the things you can do with homebrew, it should give you a starting point for things you can do. Our guide is meant for you to easily get started, but we have links associated with the things on the list to help you get started.
