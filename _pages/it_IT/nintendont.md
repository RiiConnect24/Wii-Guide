This is a quick start guide on how to use Nintendont, a popular loader for the Wii that's used to play GameCube games from a USB drive, SD card, or directly from your disc drive.

#### What you need

- Una Wii
- Una scheda SD o un'unit√† USB

We recommend you copy games over with [GameCube Backup Manager](https://github.com/AxionDrak/GameCube-Backup-Manager/releases) if you use Windows.

To play games, we recommend using an external hard drive for your Wii. Flash drives are not recommended, and may vary in behavior even between the same product.

Make sure your USB drive is formatted as FAT32. Do not format it as other types such as exFAT or NTFS.
