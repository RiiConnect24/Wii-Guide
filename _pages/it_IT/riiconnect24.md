##### Section IV - Connecting

{% capture notice-1 %}
The old DNS server `164.132.44.106` has been deprecated as of `June 1st, 2023` and is no longer available to use. [Read more here](riiconnect24-dns-update).
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--warning">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

You will now set your DNS to our servers. This is optional but it's recommended, because it enhances the use of RiiConnect24 and Wiimmfi by making some other features available.

1. Go to `Wii Options`.
2. Go to `Wii Settings`.
3. Go to `Page 2`, then click on `Internet`.
4. Go to `Connection Settings`.
5. Select your current connection.
6. Go to `Change Settings`.
7. Go to `Auto-Obtain DNS` (Not IP Address), then select `No`, then `Advanced Settings`.
8. Type in `167.86.108.126` as the primary DNS.
9. Type in `1.1.1.1` as the secondary DNS.
10. Select `Confirm`, then select `Save`.
11. Select `OK` to perform a connection test.
12. If the connection test was successful, select `No` to skip the Wii System Update.
13. Go to `WiiConnect24`, then `WiiConnect24` again, and make sure it is enabled.
14. Back on the WiiConnect24 menu, go to `Standby Connection` and make sure it is enabled.
15. At `Slot Illumination`, we recommend you set the disc light to `Dim` or `Bright`, but this is optional.
16. Finally, go to the `Internet` section, then `User Agreements` or `Agreement/Contact`, then `Yes`. Please read through this.

It's common to get error FORE000006 on the Forecast Channel after installing RiiConnect24. If you get it, make sure your Wii's to the correct date and time, then wait no more than an hour and it may start working. [If you still get error FORE000006 or if you get NEWS000006, you will need to delete your SYSCONF with RC24-Clear-Tool](deleting-vffs).
{: .notice--warning}

If you get error 107245, then you have not installed the patched IOS. Make sure you install IOS31 and IOS80 with YAWM ModMii Edition, along with any other patched WADs.
{: .notice--warning}

If you get error 220602 when loading the User Agreements, it means your Wii is still configured to use the old DNS server, which has been shut down on `June 1, 2023`. [Read more here.](riiconnect24-dns-update)
{: .notice--warning}

If you get error 107304 or you see Nintendo's User Agreement without RiiConnect24's logo, that means your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or network is blocking the use of a DNS. You can set `Auto-Obtain DNS` to `On` to solve this. RiiConnect24 will still work without it. Or, you can use our [DNS-Server](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/releases/latest) program.
{: .notice--warning}

[If you're getting any other errors with the Forecast Channel or the News Channel, such as an error code starting with FORE or NEWS or a discontinued message, you can try to delete your VFFs with RC24-Clear-Tool](deleting-vffs).
{: .notice--warning}

If you're getting errors such as `WiiConnect24 and Wii Shop Channel currently not being offered in your country`, go to Wii Settings -> Last Page -> Country and change it to United Kingdom. You will get this error when using a country that we don't support. Contact us at [support@riiconnect24.net](mailto:support@riiconnect24.net) if you need more help.
