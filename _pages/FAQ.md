<a name="faq_latestfw" />**Q:** *I am on the latest system version, is my device hackable?*    
**A:** Yes, but only by [downgrading its NFIRM](nfirm-downgrade) (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/4iry4s/)).

<a name="faq_updatecfw" />**Q:** *How do I update Luma3DS?*    
**A:** Use Luma3DS Updater

<a name="faq_gatewaysky" />**Q:** *I heard about this thing I have to pay for (Gateway, Sky3DS, etc), is that something I need?*    
**A:** No. arm9loaderhax is a superior method of loading hax that runs early in boot and opens up the opportunity for things such as true custom firmware.

<a name="faq_gatewaysaves" />**Q:** *How do I move saves from an existing Gateway setup to device installed games?*    
**A:** See [this](https://gbatemp.net/threads/425743/)

<a name="faq_need" />**Q:** *What do I need to do this guide?*    
**A:** This guide can be completely done with free software and (if you have no browser) a compatible game   

<a name="faq_risky" />**Q:** *How risky is hacking my console?*    
**A:** Bricks are now *basically* impossible unless you ignore/circumvent all safety checks.

<a name="faq_homebrew" />**Q:** *Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this?*    
**A:** Yes! Custom Firmware not only enables the Homebrew Launcher, but it also will give you hacks on all versions, which means you keep it forever, even with updates.

<a name="faq_regionfree" />**Q:** *Can I use this to play games from other regions?*    
**A:** Luma3DS supports Region Free patches, which enables users to install games from any region without any extra modification or steps.

<a name="faq_updates" />**Q:** *Is it safe to update CFW SysNAND?*    
**A:** Yes. This is safe, stop asking about it.

<a name="faq_support" />**Q:** *Where should I go for support?*    
**A:** For support, ask for help at [#3dshacks on Rizon IRC](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/wiki/irc) or [3DS Hacking on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).  

<a name="faq_le4gbsd" />**Q:** *Can I do this with a 4GB (or smaller) SD card?*    
**A:** Thanks to the new CTRNAND method, yes!

<a name="faq_ge128gbsd" />**Q:** *Can I use a 128 GB (or larger) SD card?*    
**A:** Yes, but some users have reported slowdowns when using such large sizes. Note that you cannot format the card with exFAT; you need to format it with FAT32.

<a name="faq_movesd" />**Q:** *How do I move to a new SD card at the end of this?*    
**A:** Just copy all the files to the new SD card.

<a name="faq_NNID" />**Q:** *Can I keep my NNID?*    
**A:** If you start with an NNID and follow every step, you will end up keeping your NNID at the end.

<a name="faq_systransfer" />**Q:** *What about System Transfers?*    
**A:** Once you have completed the guide, you can system transfer to and from an arm9loaderhax'd 3DS or 2DS exactly like you would a regular stock console or EmuNAND (you will lose any non-legitimate games/themes/DLC in the transfer; saves will stay even for games that are lost).

<a name="faq_nopc" />**Q:** *Can I do this without a computer (e.g. an Android phone)?*    
**A:** All you need is the ability to put files on an SD card!

<a name="faq_problem" />**Q:** *Help! Something bad happened and now I cannot boot...*    
**A:** Please look at the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting).
