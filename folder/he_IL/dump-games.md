These tutorials will teach you how to legally dump a GameCube/Wii disk. You can dump it to either your SD card/USB drive or to your PC using Wi-Fi or an Ethernet adapter.

Dumping to your SD card or USB Drive is quicker but it will take up space on your SD card. If the space is not available and you do not mind the slow speed of Internet travels, you could dump it to your PC.

## Store it on a USB drive or an SD card
#### Requirements

* A Wii with an Internet connection
* An SD card or USB drive with at least 4.7 GB of free space
* [CleanRip](https://github.com/emukidid/cleanrip/releases/latest)

#### Instructions
##### Section I - Downloading/Installing

1. Extract CleanRip and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD card or USB drive.
2. Insert your SD card into your Wii, and launch CleanRip from the Homebrew Channel.

##### Section II - Ripping

1. Select your device that you will be dumping the game to - your USB drive or SD card. ![Device type](/images/CleanRip/2.png)
2. On this screen, it asks you if you want to download a file with game checksums so you can verify the dump created is a 1:1 copy of the disc. It's your choice whether to say `Yes` or `No` to download this file. ![DAT](/images/CleanRip/3.png)
3. Now insert the game you'd like to dump. ![DVD](/images/CleanRip/4.png) ![Initialising Disc](/images/CleanRip/5.png)
4. Set it as shown on the screen below.
   - If you know that you are dumping a game that uses a dual layer disc, like `Super Smash Bros. Brawl` or `Metroid: Other M`, set `Dual Layer` to `Yes`. ![Settings](/images/CleanRip/6.png)
5. CleanRip will now dump your game. It can take a while, since it will dump the full 4.7GB disc contents (9.4 for dual layer discs). ![Copying](/images/CleanRip/7.png)
